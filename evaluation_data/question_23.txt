问题:
From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $ N $ cents, where $ N $ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called **greedy algorithm**, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $ N $. For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.

In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $ N $ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $ N $ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $ N $ between 1 and 1000 inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.
