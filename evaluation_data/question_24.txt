We need to solve: There are n values of x in interval 0 < x < 2π where f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0. For t of these n values, the graph is tangent to the x-axis. Find n + t.

Step 1: Condition for zeros.

f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0 ⇒ 7π sin(5x) = kπ for integer k ⇒ 7 sin(5x) = k ⇒ sin(5x) = k/7, where k ∈ ℤ.

Since sine is between -1 and 1, we require -1 ≤ k/7 ≤ 1 ⇒ -7 ≤ k ≤ 7. So possible integer k: -7, -6, ..., 6, 7. There are 15 distinct k.

Step 2: For each k, count the number of x in (0, 2π) such that sin(5x) = k/7.

Let a = k/7. We need to solve sin(5x) = a, with 0 < x < 2π ⇔ 0 < 5x < 10π.

We consider the equation sin θ = a, where θ = 5x, θ ∈ (0, 10π). The number of solutions depends on a.

We have the general solution: θ = arcsin(a) + 2πn or θ = π - arcsin(a) + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ.

We need to count distinct θ in (0, 10π) that satisfy this.

Important: The interval (0, 10π) covers exactly 5 full periods of sine (each period 2π). For a generic a with -1 < a < 1 and a ≠ 0, in each period of length 2π there are exactly two solutions to sin θ = a, provided a is not ±1. So in 5 periods, we would expect 10 solutions. But careful: The periods are intervals like (0, 2π), (2π, 4π), ..., (8π, 10π). However, at the boundaries between periods, sin θ = a might occur exactly at the boundaries? Boundaries are multiples of π, but sin θ at multiples of π is 0 (except if a=0). For a ≠ 0, boundaries do not satisfy sin θ = a. So indeed for each a with 0 < |a| < 1, we get exactly 10 solutions in θ ∈ (0, 10π). However, we must be careful about a = 0 and a = ±1.

Let's handle each case separately.

Case 1: a = 0, i.e., k = 0.
sin θ = 0 ⇒ θ = mπ, m ∈ ℤ. We need 0 < θ < 10π, so θ = π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π. But careful: Are all these inside open interval (0,10π)? Yes, π, 2π, ..., 9π are all >0 and <10π. That gives 9 solutions. However, we must check if any of these are endpoints of the subintervals? They are at multiples of π, and indeed some are at boundaries of the 5 periods: 2π, 4π, 6π, 8π, 10π. But 10π is not included, 0 not included. So among these, 2π, 4π, 6π, 8π are included. Are these valid? Since the interval is open, θ = 2π is in (0,10π)? Yes, because 0 < 2π < 10π. So we count them. So there are 9 solutions: m = 1,2,...,9. Thus for k=0, number of x = number of θ divided by 1? Actually each θ corresponds to x = θ/5. So indeed number of x = number of distinct θ. So N(k=0) = 9.

Wait, let's double-check: sin θ = 0 at θ = 0, π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π, 10π, ... In (0, 10π), we exclude 0 and 10π, so we have π through 9π inclusive. That's 9 values. Yes.

But the previous answer claimed 5. That was incorrect because they considered only one solution per period, but actually each period (0,2π) contains two zeros: at π and at 2π? Wait, in the open interval (0, 2π), sin θ = 0 at θ = π only, because at θ = 0 and 2π, the interval is open so they are excluded. So in (0,2π), only one zero. In (2π,4π), zeros at 3π only (2π and 4π excluded). So that gives 1 per period, total 5. But then what about 2π, 4π, etc? They are boundaries between periods. If we consider the whole interval (0,10π) without subdivision, they are inside. For example, θ=2π is inside (0,10π) because 0 < 2π < 10π. So we must count it. However, if we subdivide into (0,2π), (2π,4π), etc., then 2π is not included in either because (0,2π) does not include 2π, and (2π,4π) does not include 2π. That's the mistake: when subdividing, we cannot exclude points that are exactly at the boundaries if they are part of the overall open interval. The correct approach is to consider the entire interval (0,10π) and find all θ that satisfy sin θ = 0. That gives π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π — 9 points. So N(0)=9.

Case 2: a = 1, i.e., k=7.
sin θ = 1 ⇒ θ = π/2 + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ. In (0,10π), we need 0 < π/2 + 2πn < 10π.
π/2 + 2πn > 0 ⇒ n ≥ 0 (since n=0 gives π/2>0). π/2 + 2πn < 10π ⇒ 2πn < 10π - π/2 = 19π/2 ⇒ n < 19/4 = 4.75 ⇒ n = 0,1,2,3,4. That gives 5 solutions. Similarly, check: for n=0: π/2; n=1: 5π/2; n=2: 9π/2; n=3: 13π/2; n=4: 17π/2. All in (0,10π). So N(7)=5.

Case 3: a = -1, i.e., k=-7.
sin θ = -1 ⇒ θ = 3π/2 + 2πn. 0 < 3π/2 + 2πn < 10π ⇒ 3π/2 + 2πn > 0 ⇒ n ≥ 0. 2πn < 10π - 3π/2 = 17π/2 ⇒ n < 17/4 = 4.25 ⇒ n = 0,1,2,3,4. So θ = 3π/2, 7π/2, 11π/2, 15π/2, 19π/2. That's 5 solutions. So N(-7)=5.

Case 4: a with 0 < |a| < 1, i.e., k = ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6. For each such a, there are exactly 10 solutions in θ ∈ (0,10π). Let's verify carefully: In each interval of length 2π, say (2πj, 2π(j+1)) for j=0,...,4, the equation sin θ = a has exactly two solutions if a is not ±1. The only potential issue is if one of these solutions coincides with a boundary, but that would require a = 0 or ±1. So for 0 < |a| < 1, no solution is at a boundary. So each of the 5 intervals contributes exactly 2 solutions, total 10. This is true for each such k. So for each k with 1 ≤ |k| ≤ 6, N(k)=10.

Now we have 12 such k: -6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6. So total from these: 12 * 10 = 120.

Plus k=0: 9 solutions.
Plus k=7: 5 solutions.
Plus k=-7: 5 solutions.

Total n = 120 + 9 + 5 + 5 = 139.

So n = 139.

Step 3: Tangency condition.

We need to find among the zeros those where the graph is tangent to the x-axis. That means f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0.

Compute f'(x):
f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x))
f'(x) = cos(7π sin(5x)) * 7π * cos(5x) * 5 = 35π cos(5x) cos(7π sin(5x)).

At a zero, we have 7π sin(5x) = kπ ⇒ sin(5x) = k/7, and cos(7π sin(5x)) = cos(kπ) = (-1)^k.

Thus f'(x) = 35π cos(5x) (-1)^k.

For tangency, f'(x)=0 ⇒ cos(5x)=0 (since 35π ≠ 0 and (-1)^k ≠ 0).

So we need sin(5x)=k/7 and cos(5x)=0. But if cos(5x)=0, then sin^2(5x)=1, so sin(5x)=±1, i.e., k/7 = ±1 ⇒ k = ±7.

Thus, tangency occurs exactly at zeros with k=7 or k=-7. For these, we already have cos(5x)=0 automatically (since sin(5x)=±1 implies cos(5x)=0). So all zeros with k=±7 are tangency points.

So t = number of zeros with k=±7 = N(7) + N(-7) = 5 + 5 = 10.

Step 4: Compute n + t = 139 + 10 = 149.

Thus final answer is 149.

But wait: we should double-check N(0) = 9. Let's explicitly list x for k=0: sin(5x)=0 ⇒ 5x = mπ, m integer. x = mπ/5. Condition 0 < x < 2π ⇒ 0 < mπ/5 < 2π ⇒ 0 < m < 10. So m = 1,2,...,9. That gives 9 values. Yes.

So n = 139, t = 10, sum = 149.

Now, check previous critique: they said correct n = 139, so answer should be 149.

Thus final answer: 149.

We should also consider if there is any possibility of double counting? No, each x gives unique k because sin(5x) is uniquely determined.

Also, are there any tangency points where f'(x)=0 because cos(7π sin(5x))=0? That would require 7π sin(5x) = π/2 + nπ ⇒ sin(5x) = (1/2 + n)/7, which is not of the form k/7 with integer k (since numerator is half-integer). So these are not zeros. So only tangency at zeros with k=±7.

Thus answer is 149.
</think>
We are given \( f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) \) and seek the number \( n \) of zeros in \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), and the number \( t \) of those zeros where the graph is tangent to the \( x \)-axis.

---

**Step 1: Condition for zeros**

\[
f(x) = 0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sin(7\pi \sin(5x)) = 0.
\]

This occurs when  
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = k\pi \quad (k \in \mathbb{Z}) \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}.
\]

Since \(-1 \le \sin(5x) \le 1\), we must have \(-7 \le k \le 7\). Thus, possible integer values are  
\[
k = -7, -6, \dots, 6, 7.
\]

---

**Step 2: Counting zeros for each \( k \)**

Let \( a = k/7 \). Solve \(\sin(5x) = a\) for \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), i.e., \( 0 < 5x < 10\pi \).  
Write \( \theta = 5x \); we count distinct \( \theta \in (0, 10\pi) \) with \(\sin \theta = a\).

- **Case \( |k| \le 6, k \ne 0 \)** (so \( 0 < |a| < 1 \)):  
  In each interval of length \( 2\pi \), \(\sin \theta = a\) has exactly two solutions. Since \((0, 10\pi)\) consists of 5 such intervals, there are \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) solutions for each such \( k \).

- **Case \( k = 0 \)** (\( a = 0 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = 0 \Rightarrow \theta = m\pi,\ m \in \mathbb{Z}\).  
  In \( 0 < \theta < 10\pi \), we have \( \theta = \pi, 2\pi, \dots, 9\pi \). That gives 9 solutions.

- **Case \( k = 7 \)** (\( a = 1 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = 1 \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi n\).  
  Solving \( 0 < \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi n < 10\pi \) yields \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \), so 5 solutions.

- **Case \( k = -7 \)** (\( a = -1 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = -1 \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2\pi n\).  
  Similarly, \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \) gives 5 solutions.

Thus, the number of zeros is  
\[
n = \underbrace{12 \times 10}_{|k|=1,\dots,6} \;+\; 9 \;+\; 5 \;+\; 5 = 120 + 19 = 139.
\]

---

**Step 3: Tangency condition**

A zero is a point of tangency to the \( x \)-axis if \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f'(x) = 0 \).  
Differentiating:  
\[
f'(x) = \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) \cdot 7\pi \cos(5x) \cdot 5 = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)).
\]  
At a zero, \( 7\pi \sin(5x) = k\pi \), so \(\cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) = \cos(k\pi) = (-1)^k\). Hence  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi (-1)^k \cos(5x).
\]  
For tangency, we require \(\cos(5x) = 0\). Together with \(\sin(5x) = k/7\), this implies \(\sin^2(5x) = 1\), so \( k/7 = \pm 1 \) and thus \( k = \pm 7 \).

Therefore, tangency occurs exactly at the zeros with \( k = \pm 7 \). All such zeros are tangent points. Hence  
\[
t = (\text{number of zeros with } k=7) + (\text{number with } k=-7) = 5 + 5 = 10.
\]

---

**Step 4: Compute \( n + t \)**

\[
n + t = 139 + 10 = 149.
\]

---

\[
\boxed{149}

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

We have \( f(x) = \sin\left(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)\right) \), defined for \( 0 < x < 2\pi \).

**Step 1: Condition for zeros of \( f(x) \)**
We want \( f(x) = 0 \), so:
\[
\sin\left(7\pi \sin(5x)\right) = 0.
\]
This means:
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
That is:
\[
7 \sin(5x) = m, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]

So:
\[
\sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7}.
\]
Because sine is between -1 and 1:
\[
-1 \le \frac{m}{7} \le 1 \implies -7 \le m \le 7, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
So possible \( m \) are: \( m = -7, -6, -5, \dots, 6, 7 \). That's 15 values of \( m \).

**Step 2: Solving \( \sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7} \)**
For each \( m \), the equation \( \sin(5x) = a \), where \( a = m/7 \), has two families of solutions in general in one period of sine:
\[
5x = \arcsin(a) + 2\pi k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z},
\]
\[
5x = \pi - \arcsin(a) + 2\pi k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
But sometimes these families coincide if \( a = \pm 1 \) (i.e., \( m = \pm 7 \)).

We are only interested in \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), so \( x \in (0, 2\pi) \).

Since \( 5x \) runs over \( (0, 10\pi) \), which is \( 5 \) full periods of sine (\( 2\pi \) each).

 each \( m \), the number of \( x \) in \( (0, 2\pi) \) satisfying \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \) is the number of solutions to \( 5x \in (0, 10\pi) \) satisfying the above two equations.

Let's analyze generic \( m \) with \( -6 \le m \le 6 \) and \( m \neq 0 \) possibly, but including \( m=0 \), and special \( m=\pm7 \).

First, note that \( m \) integer between -7 and 7 inclusive, \( a = m/7 \) is rational.

**Step 3: Number of solutions for given \( a \)**
In \( 5x \in (0, 10\pi) \), there are 5 periods of sine. In each period of \( 2\pi \), the equation \( \sin \theta = a \) (with \( -1 < a < 1 \) and \( a \neq 0 \)) has 2 solutions. So in \( \theta \in (0, 10\pi) \), we'd expect \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) solutions for generic \( a \) with \( |a|<1 \), \( a \neq 0 \). But careful: boundaries? \( \theta \) strictly between 0 and \( 10\pi \), so not including \( 0, 10\pi \). That's fine, 5 full periods essentially: periods: \( (0,2\pi) \), \( (2\pi, 4\pi) \), \( (4\pi, 6\pi) \), \( (6\pi, 8\pi) \), \( (8\pi, 10\pi) \). In each open interval of length \( 2\pi \), there are exactly 2 solutions to \( \sin \theta = a \) if \( |a|<1 \), because \( \sin \theta = a \) has two solutions per period, one in \( (0,\pi) \) and one in \( (\pi, 2\pi) \) for each translated period. So indeed 10 solutions for each \( m \) with \( |m| \le 6 \), \( m \neq 0 \

), but also \( m=0 \) needs separate check.

Wait, for \( a=0 \): \( \sin \theta = 0 \), in each period of length \( 2\pi \), there are two solutions: \( \theta = 0, \pi \) in principal, but in each translated period \( (2\pi k, 2\pi k + 2\pi) \), the zeros are at \( \theta = 2\pi k + \pi \) and at the boundary? Actually within open interval \( (2\pi k, 2\pi k+2\pi) \), \( \sin \theta =0 \) at \( \theta = 2\pi k + \pi \) only; the other zero is at the boundary \( 2\pi k \) or \( 2\pi k+2\pi \), which is excluded if interval is open. So for open interval \( (0, 10\pi) \), zeros occur at \( \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, 7\pi, 9\pi \) — that's 5 solutions, not 10. So for \( m=0 \), there are only 5 solutions in \( (0,10\pi) \).

Similarly for \( |a|=1 \): For \( a=1 \) (\( m=7 \)), \( \sin \theta =1 \) occurs at \( \theta = \pi/2 + 2\pi k \). In \( (0,10\pi) \), possible \( k \): \( k=0,1,2,3,4 \): \( \pi/2, 5\pi/2, 9\pi/2, 13\pi/2, 17\pi/2 \) — all in the interval? Check: \( 17\pi/2 = 8.5\pi < 10\pi \), yes. So 5 solutions. Similarly for \( a=-1 \) (\( m=-7 \)), \( \sin \theta = -1 \) at \( \theta = 3\pi/2 + 2\pi k \), \( k=0,\dots,4 \): \( 3\pi/2, 7\pi/2, 11\pi/2, 15\pi/2, 19\

pi/2 \) (19π/2 = 9.5π < 10π) — also 5 solutions.

Thus summary: For each \( m \) with \( 1 \le |m| \le 6 \), \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \) has 10 distinct solutions for \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \) ⇒ so \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \) has 10 solutions? Wait: careful: \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \) corresponds to \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \). Each solution for \( 5x \) gives one \( x \). So if there are \( N \) solutions for \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \), then there are \( N \) solutions for \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \). So for \( |m| \le 6, m\neq0 \), \( N=10 \). For \( m=0 \), \( N=5 \). For \( |m|=7 \), \( N=5 \).

But is that always true? Let’s check m=1: a=1/7 ≈ 0.142857. Two solutions per period in 5x, so indeed 10 total. Similarly for m=-1, etc. So each m from -6 to -1 and 1 to 6 gives 10 solutions, m=0 gives 5, m=±7 gives 5.

However, we must be careful: Could there be double-counting? The original equation sin(7π sin(5x))=0 gives condition 7 sin(5x)=m. Each x that satisfies this for some integer m is a zero. Different m give different values of sin(5x) (except possibly at boundaries? no, distinct m give distinct a=m/7), so each x is associated with exactly one m. So total n = number of distinct x in (0,2π) satisfying sin(7π sin(5x))=0 = sum over m of number of x satisfying sin(5x)=m/7.

Thus:
\[
n = \sum_{m=-7}^{7} \#\{ x \in (0,2\pi)

Let’s compute:

m = -7: 5 solutions
m = -6: 10 solutions
m = -5: 10
m = -4: 10
m = -3: 10
m = -2: 10
m = -1: 10
m = 0: 5
m = 1: 10
m = 2: 10
m = 3: 10
m = 4: 10
m = 5: 10
m = 6: 10
m = 7: 5

Sum: 
For m from -6 to -1: 6×10 = 60
For m from 1 to 6: 6×10 = 60
m=0: 5
m=±7: 5+5=10

Total n = 60+60+5+10 = 135.

So n = 135.

**Step 4: Tangency condition**
Now: We need t = number of these x where the graph of y=f(x) is tangent to x-axis. Tangency to x-axis means f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0 at that x.

So find x such that f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0.

Compute f'(x):
\[
f'(x) = \cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right) \cdot 7\pi \cdot \cos(5x) \cdot 5.
\]
Simplify:
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right).
\]
At a zero: \( 7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi \), so \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \), and \( m \) integer.

Thus at such x:
\[
\cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right) = \cos(m\pi) = (-1)^m.
\]
So:
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cdot (-1)^m.
\]
For tangency, we need f'(x)=0, i.e., since \( 35\pi \neq

 0 \), we need:
\[
\cos(5x) = 0.
\]
So the condition: At a zero x, we also need cos(5x)=0.

But we already have \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \). So together:
\[
\sin(5x) = m/7, \quad \cos(5x) = 0.
\]
But if cos(5x)=0, then sin(5x) = ±1. Indeed, since sin²+cos²=1, we have |sin(5x)|=1. So m/7 = ±1, hence m = ±7.

Thus, tangency occurs only for m=7 or m=-7.

So among the zeros with m=7 (i.e., sin(5x)=1) or m=-7 (sin(5x)=-1), we need those x where cos(5x)=0 as well. Wait: If sin(5x)=1, then cos(5x)=0 necessarily? Actually not necessarily: For sin θ=1, we have θ = π/2 + 2πk, at those points cos θ=0. Similarly, for sin θ=-1, θ= -π/2 + 2πk or equivalently 3π/2+2πk, cos θ=0. So indeed for m=±7, automatically cos(5x)=0. Check: For m=7: sin(5x)=1 ⇒ cos(5x)=0. So f'(x)=35π * 0 * (-1)^7 = 0. So indeed all zeros with m=±7 are tangency points.

But wait, are there any other possibilities where f'(x)=0 because cos(mπ)=0? That would require m half-integer, but m is integer, so cos(mπ) = ±1, never 0. So indeed the only way f'(x)=0 is cos(5x)=0, which forces sin(5x)=±1.

Thus, all zeros with m=±7 are tangency points. And also, possibly, what if cos(mπ)=0? That can't happen. So tangency occurs exactly at zeros where sin(5x)=±1, i.e., m=±7.

Now we must check: Could there be any other tangency points where cos

(5x)=0 but f(x)≠0? That would not be tangency to x-axis because not on axis. So only zeros with m=±7 matter.

So t = number of x in (0,2π) satisfying sin(5x)=1 or sin(5x)=-1.

We already computed: For m=7: number of solutions = 5. For m=-7: number = 5. But are they distinct? Yes, sin(5x)=1 gives x such that 5x = π/2 + 2πk ⇒ x = π/10 + 2πk/5. For x in (0,2π): k=0,...,4: x=π/10, π/2, 9π/10, 13π/10, 17π/10. Wait check: k=0: π/10, k=1: π/10+2π/5 = π/10+4π/10=5π/10=π/2, k=2: π/10+4π/5=π/10+8π/10=9π/10, k=3: π/10+6π/5=π/10+12π/10=13π/10, k=4: π/10+8π/5=π/10+16π/10=17π/10. All in (0,2π). For m=-7: sin(5x)=-1 ⇒ 5x = 3π/2 + 2πk ⇒ x = 3π/10 + 2πk/5. k=0: 3π/10, k=1: 3π/10+2π/5=3π/10+4π/10=7π/10, k=2: 3π/10+4π/5=3π/10+8π/10=11π/10, k=3: 3π/10+6π/5=3π/10+12π/10=15π/10=3π/2, k=4: 3π/10+8π/5=3π/10+16π/10=19π/10. Also all in (0,2π).

So total t = 5+5=10.

: Check if any of these coincide?** No, sin(5x)=1 and sin(5x)=-1 give disjoint sets (since 1 ≠ -1). So t=10.

Thus n+t = 135+10=145.

Wait, but careful: The problem says: "For t of these n values of x, the graph of y=f(x) is tangent to the x-axis." That means among the zeros, some are tangency points. So t is subset of n. Did we include the tangency points in n? Yes, because n counts all zeros. So t should be included in n. Then n+t would be counting t twice? Possibly they mean just the sum n+t as separate numbers.

Looking at the wording: "Find n + t." They want the sum of the two numbers. Since t is a subset of n, n+t is n plus the number of tangency points, effectively counting tangency points twice in the sum. That's fine, they just want the arithmetic sum.

So our answer should be 135+10=145.

But I need to verify carefully the count of n. Did we overcount? Because sometimes the equation sin(5x)=m/7 might have multiple m giving the same x? Unlikely since different m give different values of sin(5x). So each x corresponds to a unique m. So n = total solutions over all m.

But maybe we should check if there are any x for which sin(5x)=m/7 and also sin(5x)=m'/7 with m≠m'? That would require m/7=m'/7 ⇒ m=m'. So distinct m give distinct sin(5x) values, so x satisfying one cannot satisfy another. So no overlap.

So n = sum_{m} N(m), where N(m) is number of x in (0,2π) with sin(5x)=m/7.

Let’s recompute N(m) carefully because earlier I assumed 10 for |m|≤6, m≠0, but maybe some m give fewer solutions if the arcsines align with boundaries? Actually the count should be: In interval 5x ∈ (0,10π), the number of solutions to sin θ = a with a fixed -1<a<1, a≠0, is exactly 10. Reason: In each of the 5 periods (0,2π), (2π,4π),

..., (8π,10π), there are exactly 2 solutions. So indeed 10.

For a=0: In each period, sin θ=0 has two zeros, but at endpoints of periods: Actually sin θ=0 at θ = 0, π, 2π, 3π, 4π,... In the open interval (0,10π), zeros at π, 2π, 3π, 4π, ..., 9π. But careful: In our subdivision into periods: For interval (0,2π): zeros at π only (since 0 and 2π are excluded). For (2π,4π): zero at 3π only (since 2π, 4π excluded). For (4π,6π): 5π only. For (6π,8π): 7π only. For (8π,10π): 9π only. So total 5. So indeed N(0)=5.

For a=1: sin θ=1 at θ = π/2, 5π/2, 9π/2, 13π/2, 17π/2 — all inside the open intervals? Check: π/2 ∈ (0,2π), 5π/2 ∈ (2π,4π), 9π/2 ∈ (4π,6π), 13π/2 ∈ (6π,8π), 17π/2 ∈ (8π,10π). So 5.

Similarly for a=-1: 3π/2, 7π/2, 11π/2, 15π/2, 19π/2. Also 5.

So our count is correct.

Thus n = 10*(12) + 5 + 5 + 5 = 10*12 + 15 = 120+15=135. Wait, m from -6 to -1: 6 values; m from 1 to 6: 6 values; total 12 values with |m| 1..6, each 10 → 120. Then m=0: 5, m=7:5, m=-7:5 → 15. Sum=135. Good.

t = number of zeros with m=±7 = 5+5=10.

 any other tangency? What if cos(7π sin(5x))=0 at zero? That would require 7π sin(5x) = (k+1/2)π, i.e., 7 sin(5x)=k+1/2, but then sin(5x) = (2k+1)/14, which is not an integer/7 unless (2k+1)/14 = m/7 ⇒ 2k+1=2m ⇒ impossible since left odd, right even. So no.

Thus final answer is 145.
</think>
The function \( f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) \) is zero when  
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi \quad \text{for some integer } m,
\]  
or equivalently \(\sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7}\), where \(-7 \le m \le 7\). For each integer \(m\) in this range, we find the number of \(x \in (0, 2\pi)\) satisfying \(\sin(5x) = m/7\).

- For \(1 \le |m| \le 6\): The equation \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) has exactly 10 solutions in \((0, 2\pi)\).  
- For \(m = 0\): \(\sin(5x) = 0\) has 5 solutions.  
- For \(m = \pm 7\): \(\sin(5x) = \pm 1\) has 5 solutions each.

Thus, the total number \(n\) of zeros is  
\[
n = 12 \times 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 120 + 15 = 135.
\]

A zero corresponds to a tangency point if the derivative \(f'(x)\) also vanishes. Computing the derivative:  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)).
\]  
At a zero where \(7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi\), we have \(\cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) = (-1)^m\), so  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi

Thus, tangency requires \(\cos(5x) = 0\), which together with \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) implies \(\sin(5x) = \pm 1\), i.e., \(m = \pm 7\). Therefore, all zeros with \(m = \pm 7\) are points of tangency. There are 5 solutions for \(m = 7\) and 5 for \(m = -7\), so  
\[
t = 5 + 5 = 10.

Finally,  
\[
n + t = 135 + 10 = 145.

评论:
The solution correctly derives the condition for zeros, \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) with \(m \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(-7 \le m \le 7\), and identifies that tangency occurs only for \(m = \pm 7\). However, there is an error in counting the number of solutions for \(m = 0\). The answer claims that \(\sin(5x) = 0\) has 5 solutions in \(0 < x < 2\pi\), but the correct count is 9. This mistake arises from incorrectly treating boundaries when subdividing the interval for \(5x\). As a result, the calculated \(n = 135\) is incorrect; the correct \(n = 139\). This error also affects \(n + t\), giving 145 instead of 149. The issue pertains to correctness and accuracy, leading to a 5-point deduction.

We need to solve: There are n values of x in interval 0 < x < 2π where f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0. For t of these n values, the graph is tangent to the x-axis. Find n + t.

Step 1: Condition for zeros.

f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0 ⇒ 7π sin(5x) = kπ for integer k ⇒ 7 sin(5x) = k ⇒ sin(5x) = k/7, where k ∈ ℤ.

Since sine is between -1 and 1, we require -1 ≤ k/7 ≤ 1 ⇒ -7 ≤ k ≤ 7. So possible integer k: -7, -6, ..., 6, 7. There are 15 distinct k.

Step 2: For each k, count the number of x in (0, 2π) such that sin(5x) = k/7.

Let a = k/7. We need to solve sin(5x) = a, with 0 < x < 2π ⇔ 0 < 5x < 10π.

We consider the equation sin θ = a, where θ = 5x, θ ∈ (0, 10π). The number of solutions depends on a.

We have the general solution: θ = arcsin(a) + 2πn or θ = π - arcsin(a) + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ.

We need to count distinct θ in (0, 10π) that satisfy this.

Important: The interval (0, 10π) covers exactly 5 full periods of sine (each period 2π). For a generic a with -1 < a < 1 and a ≠ 0, in each period of length 2π there are exactly two solutions to sin θ = a, provided a is not ±1. So in 5 periods, we would expect 10 solutions. But careful: The periods are intervals like (0, 2π), (2π, 4π), ..., (8π, 10π). However, at the boundaries between periods, sin θ = a might occur exactly at the boundaries? Boundaries are multiples of π, but sin θ at multiples of π is 0 (except if a=0). For a

 ≠ 0, boundaries do not satisfy sin θ = a. So indeed for each a with 0 < |a| < 1, we get exactly 10 solutions in θ ∈ (0, 10π). However, we must be careful about a = 0 and a = ±1.

Let's handle each case separately.

Case 1: a = 0, i.e., k = 0.
sin θ = 0 ⇒ θ = mπ, m ∈ ℤ. We need 0 < θ < 10π, so θ = π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π. But careful: Are all these inside open interval (0,10π)? Yes, π, 2π, ..., 9π are all >0 and <10π. That gives 9 solutions. However, we must check if any of these are endpoints of the subintervals? They are at multiples of π, and indeed some are at boundaries of the 5 periods: 2π, 4π, 6π, 8π, 10π. But 10π is not included, 0 not included. So among these, 2π, 4π, 6π, 8π are included. Are these valid? Since the interval is open, θ = 2π is in (0,10π)? Yes, because 0 < 2π < 10π. So we count them. So there are 9 solutions: m = 1,2,...,9. Thus for k=0, number of x = number of θ divided by 1? Actually each θ corresponds to x = θ/5. So indeed number of x = number of distinct θ. So N(k=0) = 9.

Wait, let's double-check: sin θ = 0 at θ = 0, π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π, 10π, ... In (0, 10π), we exclude 0 and 10π, so we have π through 9π inclusive. That's 9 values. Yes.

But the previous answer claimed 5. That was incorrect because they considered only

 one solution per period, but actually each period (0,2π) contains two zeros: at π and at 2π? Wait, in the open interval (0, 2π), sin θ = 0 at θ = π only, because at θ = 0 and 2π, the interval is open so they are excluded. So in (0,2π), only one zero. In (2π,4π), zeros at 3π only (2π and 4π excluded). So that gives 1 per period, total 5. But then what about 2π, 4π, etc? They are boundaries between periods. If we consider the whole interval (0,10π) without subdivision, they are inside. For example, θ=2π is inside (0,10π) because 0 < 2π < 10π. So we must count it. However, if we subdivide into (0,2π), (2π,4π), etc., then 2π is not included in either because (0,2π) does not include 2π, and (2π,4π) does not include 2π. That's the mistake: when subdividing, we cannot exclude points that are exactly at the boundaries if they are part of the overall open interval. The correct approach is to consider the entire interval (0,10π) and find all θ that satisfy sin θ = 0. That gives π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π — 9 points. So N(0)=9.

Case 2: a = 1, i.e., k=7.
sin θ = 1 ⇒ θ = π/2 + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ. In (0,10π), we need 0 < π/2 + 2πn < 10π.
π/2 + 2πn > 0 ⇒ n ≥ 0 (since n=0 gives π/2>0). π/2 + 2πn < 10π ⇒ 2πn < 10π - π/2 = 19π/2 ⇒ n < 19/4 = 4.75 ⇒ n = 0,1,2,3,4. That gives

Case 3: a = -1, i.e., k=-7.
sin θ = -1 ⇒ θ = 3π/2 + 2πn. 0 < 3π/2 + 2πn < 10π ⇒ 3π/2 + 2πn > 0 ⇒ n ≥ 0. 2πn < 10π - 3π/2 = 17π/2 ⇒ n < 17/4 = 4.25 ⇒ n = 0,1,2,3,4. So θ = 3π/2, 7π/2, 11π/2, 15π/2, 19π/2. That's 5 solutions. So N(-7)=5.

Case 4: a with 0 < |a| < 1, i.e., k = ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6. For each such a, there are exactly 10 solutions in θ ∈ (0,10π). Let's verify carefully: In each interval of length 2π, say (2πj, 2π(j+1)) for j=0,...,4, the equation sin θ = a has exactly two solutions if a is not ±1. The only potential issue is if one of these solutions coincides with a boundary, but that would require a = 0 or ±1. So for 0 < |a| < 1, no solution is at a boundary. So each of the 5 intervals contributes exactly 2 solutions, total 10. This is true for each such k. So for each k with 1 ≤ |k| ≤ 6, N(k)=10.

Now we have 12 such k: -6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6. So total from these: 12 * 10 = 120.

Plus k=0: 9 solutions.
Plus k=7: 5 solutions.

Total n = 120 + 9 + 5 + 5 = 139.

So n = 139.

Step 3: Tangency condition.

We need to find among the zeros those where the graph is tangent to the x-axis. That means f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0.

Compute f'(x):
f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x))
f'(x) = cos(7π sin(5x)) * 7π * cos(5x) * 5 = 35π cos(5x) cos(7π sin(5x)).

At a zero, we have 7π sin(5x) = kπ ⇒ sin(5x) = k/7, and cos(7π sin(5x)) = cos(kπ) = (-1)^k.

Thus f'(x) = 35π cos(5x) (-1)^k.

For tangency, f'(x)=0 ⇒ cos(5x)=0 (since 35π ≠ 0 and (-1)^k ≠ 0).

So we need sin(5x)=k/7 and cos(5x)=0. But if cos(5x)=0, then sin^2(5x)=1, so sin(5x)=±1, i.e., k/7 = ±1 ⇒ k = ±7.

Thus, tangency occurs exactly at zeros with k=7 or k=-7. For these, we already have cos(5x)=0 automatically (since sin(5x)=±1 implies cos(5x)=0). So all zeros with k=±7 are tangency points.

So t = number of zeros with k=±7 = N(7) + N(-7) = 5 + 5 = 10.

Step 4: Compute n + t = 139 + 10 = 149.

Thus final answer is 149.

But wait: we should double-check N(0) = 9. Let's explicitly list x for k=0: sin(5x)=0 ⇒ 5x = mπ, m integer. x = mπ/5. Condition 0 < x < 2π ⇒ 0 < mπ/5 < 2π ⇒ 0 < m < 10. So m = 1,2,...,9. That gives 9 values. Yes.

So n =

Now, check previous critique: they said correct n = 139, so answer should be 149.

Thus final answer: 149.

We should also consider if there is any possibility of double counting? No, each x gives unique k because sin(5x) is uniquely determined.

Also, are there any tangency points where f'(x)=0 because cos(7π sin(5x))=0? That would require 7π sin(5x) = π/2 + nπ ⇒ sin(5x) = (1/2 + n)/7, which is not of the form k/7 with integer k (since numerator is half-integer). So these are not zeros. So only tangency at zeros with k=±7.

Thus answer is 149.

We are given \( f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) \) and seek the number \( n \) of zeros in \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), and the number \( t \) of those zeros where the graph is tangent to the \( x \)-axis.

---

**Step 1: Condition for zeros**

\[
f(x) = 0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sin(7\pi \sin(5x)) = 0.
\]

This occurs when  
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = k\pi \quad (k \in \mathbb{Z}) \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}.
\]

Since \(-1 \le \sin(5x) \le 1\), we must have \(-7 \le k \le 7\). Thus, possible integer values are  
\[
k = -7, -6, \dots, 6, 7.
\]

---

**Step 2: Counting zeros for each \( k \)**

Let \( a = k/7 \). Solve \(\sin(5x) = a\) for \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), i.e., \( 0 < 5x < 10\pi \).  
Write \( \theta = 5x \); we count distinct \( \theta \in (0, 10\pi) \) with \(\sin \theta = a\).

- **Case \( k = 0 \)** (\( a = 0 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = 0 \Rightarrow \theta = m\pi,\ m \in \mathbb{Z}\).  
  In \( 0 < \theta < 10\pi \), we have \( \theta = \pi, 2\pi, \dots, 9\pi \). That gives 9 solutions.

- **Case \( k = 7 \)** (\( a = 1 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = 1 \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi n\).  
  Solving \( 0 < \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi n < 10\pi \) yields \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \), so 5 solutions.

  \(\sin \theta = -1 \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2\pi n\).

A zero is a point of tangency to the \( x \)-axis if \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f'(x) = 0 \).  
Differentiating:

At a zero, \( 7\pi \sin(5x) = k\pi \), so \(\cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) = \cos(k\pi) = (-1)^k\). Hence  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi (-1)^k \cos(5x).
\]  
For tangency, we require \(\cos(5x) = 0\). Together with \(\sin(5x) = k/7\), this implies \(\sin^2(5x) = 1\), so \( k/7 = \pm 1 \) and thus \( k = \pm 7 \).

Therefore, tangency occurs exactly at the zeros with \( k = \pm 7 \). All such zeros are tangent points. Hence  
\[
t = (\text{number of zeros with } k=7) + (\text{number with } k=-7) = 5 + 5 = 10.
\]

**Step 4: Compute \( n + t \)**

\[
n + t = 139 + 10 = 149.
\]

\[
\boxed{149}

[2026-02-25 17:34:38] [DEBUG] 生成的完整 answer:
Alright, let's break this down step by step.

We have \( f(x) = \sin\left(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)\right) \), defined for \( 0 < x < 2\pi \).

**Step 1: Condition for zeros of \( f(x) \)**
We want \( f(x) = 0 \), so:
\[
\sin\left(7\pi \sin(5x)\right) = 0.
\]
This means:
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
That is:
\[
7 \sin(5x) = m, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]

So:
\[
\sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7}.
\]
Because sine is between -1 and 1:
\[
-1 \le \frac{m}{7} \le 1 \implies -7 \le m \le 7, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
So possible \( m \) are: \( m = -7, -6, -5, \dots, 6, 7 \). That's 15 values of \( m \).

**Step 2: Solving \( \sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7} \)**
For each \( m \), the equation \( \sin(5x) = a \), where \( a = m/7 \), has two families of solutions in general in one period of sine:
\[
5x = \arcsin(a) + 2\pi k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z},
\]
\[
5x = \pi - \arcsin(a) + 2\pi k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
But sometimes these families coincide if \( a = \pm 1 \) (i.e., \( m = \pm 7 \)).

We are only interested in \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), so \( x \in (0, 2\pi) \).

Since \( 5x \) runs over \( (0, 10\pi) \), which is \( 5 \) full periods of sine (\( 2\pi \) each).

For each \( m \), the number of \( x \) in \( (0, 2\pi) \) satisfying \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \) is the number of solutions to \( 5x \in (0, 10\pi) \) satisfying the above two equations.

Let's analyze generic \( m \) with \( -6 \le m \le 6 \) and \( m \neq 0 \) possibly, but including \( m=0 \), and special \( m=\pm7 \).

First, note that \( m \) integer between -7 and 7 inclusive, \( a = m/7 \) is rational.

**Step 3: Number of solutions for given \( a \)**
In \( 5x \in (0, 10\pi) \), there are 5 periods of sine. In each period of \( 2\pi \), the equation \( \sin \theta = a \) (with \( -1 < a < 1 \) and \( a \neq 0 \)) has 2 solutions. So in \( \theta \in (0, 10\pi) \), we'd expect \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) solutions for generic \( a \) with \( |a|<1 \), \( a \neq 0 \). But careful: boundaries? \( \theta \) strictly between 0 and \( 10\pi \), so not including \( 0, 10\pi \). That's fine, 5 full periods essentially: periods: \( (0,2\pi) \), \( (2\pi, 4\pi) \), \( (4\pi, 6\pi) \), \( (6\pi, 8\pi) \), \( (8\pi, 10\pi) \). In each open interval of length \( 2\pi \), there are exactly 2 solutions to \( \sin \theta = a \) if \( |a|<1 \), because \( \sin \theta = a \) has two solutions per period, one in \( (0,\pi) \) and one in \( (\pi, 2\pi) \) for each translated period. So indeed 10 solutions for each \( m \) with \( |m| \le 6 \), \( m \neq 0 \), but also \( m=0 \) needs separate check.

Wait, for \( a=0 \): \( \sin \theta = 0 \), in each period of length \( 2\pi \), there are two solutions: \( \theta = 0, \pi \) in principal, but in each translated period \( (2\pi k, 2\pi k + 2\pi) \), the zeros are at \( \theta = 2\pi k + \pi \) and at the boundary? Actually within open interval \( (2\pi k, 2\pi k+2\pi) \), \( \sin \theta =0 \) at \( \theta = 2\pi k + \pi \) only; the other zero is at the boundary \( 2\pi k \) or \( 2\pi k+2\pi \), which is excluded if interval is open. So for open interval \( (0, 10\pi) \), zeros occur at \( \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, 7\pi, 9\pi \) — that's 5 solutions, not 10. So for \( m=0 \), there are only 5 solutions in \( (0,10\pi) \).

Similarly for \( |a|=1 \): For \( a=1 \) (\( m=7 \)), \( \sin \theta =1 \) occurs at \( \theta = \pi/2 + 2\pi k \). In \( (0,10\pi) \), possible \( k \): \( k=0,1,2,3,4 \): \( \pi/2, 5\pi/2, 9\pi/2, 13\pi/2, 17\pi/2 \) — all in the interval? Check: \( 17\pi/2 = 8.5\pi < 10\pi \), yes. So 5 solutions. Similarly for \( a=-1 \) (\( m=-7 \)), \( \sin \theta = -1 \) at \( \theta = 3\pi/2 + 2\pi k \), \( k=0,\dots,4 \): \( 3\pi/2, 7\pi/2, 11\pi/2, 15\pi/2, 19\pi/2 \) (19π/2 = 9.5π < 10π) — also 5 solutions.

Thus summary: For each \( m \) with \( 1 \le |m| \le 6 \), \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \) has 10 distinct solutions for \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \) ⇒ so \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \) has 10 solutions? Wait: careful: \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \) corresponds to \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \). Each solution for \( 5x \) gives one \( x \). So if there are \( N \) solutions for \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \), then there are \( N \) solutions for \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \). So for \( |m| \le 6, m\neq0 \), \( N=10 \). For \( m=0 \), \( N=5 \). For \( |m|=7 \), \( N=5 \).

But is that always true? Let’s check m=1: a=1/7 ≈ 0.142857. Two solutions per period in 5x, so indeed 10 total. Similarly for m=-1, etc. So each m from -6 to -1 and 1 to 6 gives 10 solutions, m=0 gives 5, m=±7 gives 5.

However, we must be careful: Could there be double-counting? The original equation sin(7π sin(5x))=0 gives condition 7 sin(5x)=m. Each x that satisfies this for some integer m is a zero. Different m give different values of sin(5x) (except possibly at boundaries? no, distinct m give distinct a=m/7), so each x is associated with exactly one m. So total n = number of distinct x in (0,2π) satisfying sin(7π sin(5x))=0 = sum over m of number of x satisfying sin(5x)=m/7.

Thus:
\[
n = \sum_{m=-7}^{7} \#\{ x \in (0,2\pi) : \sin(5x) = m/7 \}.
\]
Let’s compute:

m = -7: 5 solutions
m = -6: 10 solutions
m = -5: 10
m = -4: 10
m = -3: 10
m = -2: 10
m = -1: 10
m = 0: 5
m = 1: 10
m = 2: 10
m = 3: 10
m = 4: 10
m = 5: 10
m = 6: 10
m = 7: 5

Sum: 
For m from -6 to -1: 6×10 = 60
For m from 1 to 6: 6×10 = 60
m=0: 5
m=±7: 5+5=10

Total n = 60+60+5+10 = 135.

So n = 135.

**Step 4: Tangency condition**
Now: We need t = number of these x where the graph of y=f(x) is tangent to x-axis. Tangency to x-axis means f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0 at that x.

So find x such that f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0.

Compute f'(x):
\[
f'(x) = \cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right) \cdot 7\pi \cdot \cos(5x) \cdot 5.
\]
Simplify:
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right).
\]
At a zero: \( 7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi \), so \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \), and \( m \) integer.

Thus at such x:
\[
\cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right) = \cos(m\pi) = (-1)^m.
\]
So:
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cdot (-1)^m.
\]
For tangency, we need f'(x)=0, i.e., since \( 35\pi \neq 0 \), we need:
\[
\cos(5x) = 0.
\]
So the condition: At a zero x, we also need cos(5x)=0.

But we already have \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \). So together:
\[
\sin(5x) = m/7, \quad \cos(5x) = 0.
\]
But if cos(5x)=0, then sin(5x) = ±1. Indeed, since sin²+cos²=1, we have |sin(5x)|=1. So m/7 = ±1, hence m = ±7.

Thus, tangency occurs only for m=7 or m=-7.

So among the zeros with m=7 (i.e., sin(5x)=1) or m=-7 (sin(5x)=-1), we need those x where cos(5x)=0 as well. Wait: If sin(5x)=1, then cos(5x)=0 necessarily? Actually not necessarily: For sin θ=1, we have θ = π/2 + 2πk, at those points cos θ=0. Similarly, for sin θ=-1, θ= -π/2 + 2πk or equivalently 3π/2+2πk, cos θ=0. So indeed for m=±7, automatically cos(5x)=0. Check: For m=7: sin(5x)=1 ⇒ cos(5x)=0. So f'(x)=35π * 0 * (-1)^7 = 0. So indeed all zeros with m=±7 are tangency points.

But wait, are there any other possibilities where f'(x)=0 because cos(mπ)=0? That would require m half-integer, but m is integer, so cos(mπ) = ±1, never 0. So indeed the only way f'(x)=0 is cos(5x)=0, which forces sin(5x)=±1.

Thus, all zeros with m=±7 are tangency points. And also, possibly, what if cos(mπ)=0? That can't happen. So tangency occurs exactly at zeros where sin(5x)=±1, i.e., m=±7.

Now we must check: Could there be any other tangency points where cos(5x)=0 but f(x)≠0? That would not be tangency to x-axis because not on axis. So only zeros with m=±7 matter.

So t = number of x in (0,2π) satisfying sin(5x)=1 or sin(5x)=-1.

We already computed: For m=7: number of solutions = 5. For m=-7: number = 5. But are they distinct? Yes, sin(5x)=1 gives x such that 5x = π/2 + 2πk ⇒ x = π/10 + 2πk/5. For x in (0,2π): k=0,...,4: x=π/10, π/2, 9π/10, 13π/10, 17π/10. Wait check: k=0: π/10, k=1: π/10+2π/5 = π/10+4π/10=5π/10=π/2, k=2: π/10+4π/5=π/10+8π/10=9π/10, k=3: π/10+6π/5=π/10+12π/10=13π/10, k=4: π/10+8π/5=π/10+16π/10=17π/10. All in (0,2π). For m=-7: sin(5x)=-1 ⇒ 5x = 3π/2 + 2πk ⇒ x = 3π/10 + 2πk/5. k=0: 3π/10, k=1: 3π/10+2π/5=3π/10+4π/10=7π/10, k=2: 3π/10+4π/5=3π/10+8π/10=11π/10, k=3: 3π/10+6π/5=3π/10+12π/10=15π/10=3π/2, k=4: 3π/10+8π/5=3π/10+16π/10=19π/10. Also all in (0,2π).

So total t = 5+5=10.

**Step 5: Check if any of these coincide?** No, sin(5x)=1 and sin(5x)=-1 give disjoint sets (since 1 ≠ -1). So t=10.

Thus n+t = 135+10=145.

Wait, but careful: The problem says: "For t of these n values of x, the graph of y=f(x) is tangent to the x-axis." That means among the zeros, some are tangency points. So t is subset of n. Did we include the tangency points in n? Yes, because n counts all zeros. So t should be included in n. Then n+t would be counting t twice? Possibly they mean just the sum n+t as separate numbers.

Looking at the wording: "Find n + t." They want the sum of the two numbers. Since t is a subset of n, n+t is n plus the number of tangency points, effectively counting tangency points twice in the sum. That's fine, they just want the arithmetic sum.

So our answer should be 135+10=145.

But I need to verify carefully the count of n. Did we overcount? Because sometimes the equation sin(5x)=m/7 might have multiple m giving the same x? Unlikely since different m give different values of sin(5x). So each x corresponds to a unique m. So n = total solutions over all m.

But maybe we should check if there are any x for which sin(5x)=m/7 and also sin(5x)=m'/7 with m≠m'? That would require m/7=m'/7 ⇒ m=m'. So distinct m give distinct sin(5x) values, so x satisfying one cannot satisfy another. So no overlap.

So n = sum_{m} N(m), where N(m) is number of x in (0,2π) with sin(5x)=m/7.

Let’s recompute N(m) carefully because earlier I assumed 10 for |m|≤6, m≠0, but maybe some m give fewer solutions if the arcsines align with boundaries? Actually the count should be: In interval 5x ∈ (0,10π), the number of solutions to sin θ = a with a fixed -1<a<1, a≠0, is exactly 10. Reason: In each of the 5 periods (0,2π), (2π,4π),..., (8π,10π), there are exactly 2 solutions. So indeed 10.

For a=0: In each period, sin θ=0 has two zeros, but at endpoints of periods: Actually sin θ=0 at θ = 0, π, 2π, 3π, 4π,... In the open interval (0,10π), zeros at π, 2π, 3π, 4π, ..., 9π. But careful: In our subdivision into periods: For interval (0,2π): zeros at π only (since 0 and 2π are excluded). For (2π,4π): zero at 3π only (since 2π, 4π excluded). For (4π,6π): 5π only. For (6π,8π): 7π only. For (8π,10π): 9π only. So total 5. So indeed N(0)=5.

For a=1: sin θ=1 at θ = π/2, 5π/2, 9π/2, 13π/2, 17π/2 — all inside the open intervals? Check: π/2 ∈ (0,2π), 5π/2 ∈ (2π,4π), 9π/2 ∈ (4π,6π), 13π/2 ∈ (6π,8π), 17π/2 ∈ (8π,10π). So 5.

Similarly for a=-1: 3π/2, 7π/2, 11π/2, 15π/2, 19π/2. Also 5.

So our count is correct.

Thus n = 10*(12) + 5 + 5 + 5 = 10*12 + 15 = 120+15=135. Wait, m from -6 to -1: 6 values; m from 1 to 6: 6 values; total 12 values with |m| 1..6, each 10 → 120. Then m=0: 5, m=7:5, m=-7:5 → 15. Sum=135. Good.

t = number of zeros with m=±7 = 5+5=10.

So n+t = 145.

Double-check: Could there be any other tangency? What if cos(7π sin(5x))=0 at zero? That would require 7π sin(5x) = (k+1/2)π, i.e., 7 sin(5x)=k+1/2, but then sin(5x) = (2k+1)/14, which is not an integer/7 unless (2k+1)/14 = m/7 ⇒ 2k+1=2m ⇒ impossible since left odd, right even. So no.

Thus final answer is 145.
</think>
The function \( f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) \) is zero when  
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi \quad \text{for some integer } m,
\]  
or equivalently \(\sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7}\), where \(-7 \le m \le 7\). For each integer \(m\) in this range, we find the number of \(x \in (0, 2\pi)\) satisfying \(\sin(5x) = m/7\).

- For \(1 \le |m| \le 6\): The equation \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) has exactly 10 solutions in \((0, 2\pi)\).  
- For \(m = 0\): \(\sin(5x) = 0\) has 5 solutions.  
- For \(m = \pm 7\): \(\sin(5x) = \pm 1\) has 5 solutions each.

Thus, the total number \(n\) of zeros is  
\[
n = 12 \times 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 120 + 15 = 135.
\]

A zero corresponds to a tangency point if the derivative \(f'(x)\) also vanishes. Computing the derivative:  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)).
\]  
At a zero where \(7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi\), we have \(\cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) = (-1)^m\), so  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi (-1)^m \cos(5x).
\]  
Thus, tangency requires \(\cos(5x) = 0\), which together with \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) implies \(\sin(5x) = \pm 1\), i.e., \(m = \pm 7\). Therefore, all zeros with \(m = \pm 7\) are points of tangency. There are 5 solutions for \(m = 7\) and 5 for \(m = -7\), so  
\[
t = 5 + 5 = 10.
\]

Finally,  
\[
n + t = 135 + 10 = 145.
\]

\[
\boxed{145}

[2026-02-25 17:36:49] [DEBUG] 对应的完整 critique:
The solution correctly derives the condition for zeros, \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) with \(m \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(-7 \le m \le 7\), and identifies that tangency occurs only for \(m = \pm 7\). However, there is an error in counting the number of solutions for \(m = 0\). The answer claims that \(\sin(5x) = 0\) has 5 solutions in \(0 < x < 2\pi\), but the correct count is 9. This mistake arises from incorrectly treating boundaries when subdividing the interval for \(5x\). As a result, the calculated \(n = 135\) is incorrect; the correct \(n = 139\). This error also affects \(n + t\), giving 145 instead of 149. The issue pertains to correctness and accuracy, leading to a 5-point deduction.

Question: There are $ n $ values of $ x $ in the interval $ 0 < x < 2\pi $ where $ f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) = 0 $. For $ t $ of these $ n $ values of $ x $, the graph of $ y = f(x) $ is tangent to the $ x $-axis. Find $ n + t $.

Here are some previous responses to the question with their critiques:

Previous Answer:
Alright, let's break this down step by step.

We have \( f(x) = \sin\left(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)\right) \), defined for \( 0 < x < 2\pi \).

**Step 1: Condition for zeros of \( f(x) \)**
We want \( f(x) = 0 \), so:
\[
\sin\left(7\pi \sin(5x)\right) = 0.
\]
This means:
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
That is:
\[
7 \sin(5x) = m, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]

So:
\[
\sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7}.
\]
Because sine is between -1 and 1:
\[
-1 \le \frac{m}{7} \le 1 \implies -7 \le m \le 7, \quad m \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
So possible \( m \) are: \( m = -7, -6, -5, \dots, 6, 7 \). That's 15 values of \( m \).

**Step 2: Solving \( \sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7} \)**
For each \( m \), the equation \( \sin(5x) = a \), where \( a = m/7 \), has two families of solutions in general in one period of sine:
\[
5x = \arcsin(a) + 2\pi k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z},
\]
\[
5x = \pi - \arcsin(a) + 2\pi k, \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
But sometimes these families coincide if \( a = \pm 1 \) (i.e., \( m = \pm 7 \)).

We are only interested in \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), so \( x \in (0, 2\pi) \).

Since \( 5x \) runs over \( (0, 10\pi) \), which is \( 5 \) full periods of sine (\( 2\pi \) each).

For each \( m \), the number of \( x \) in \( (0, 2\pi) \) satisfying \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \) is the number of solutions to \( 5x \in (0, 10\pi) \) satisfying the above two equations.

Let's analyze generic \( m \) with \( -6 \le m \le 6 \) and \( m \neq 0 \) possibly, but including \( m=0 \), and special \( m=\pm7 \).

First, note that \( m \) integer between -7 and 7 inclusive, \( a = m/7 \) is rational.

**Step 3: Number of solutions for given \( a \)**
In \( 5x \in (0, 10\pi) \), there are 5 periods of sine. In each period of \( 2\pi \), the equation \( \sin \theta = a \) (with \( -1 < a < 1 \) and \( a \neq 0 \)) has 2 solutions. So in \( \theta \in (0, 10\pi) \), we'd expect \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) solutions for generic \( a \) with \( |a|<1 \), \( a \neq 0 \). But careful: boundaries? \( \theta \) strictly between 0 and \( 10\pi \), so not including \( 0, 10\pi \). That's fine, 5 full periods essentially: periods: \( (0,2\pi) \), \( (2\pi, 4\pi) \), \( (4\pi, 6\pi) \), \( (6\pi, 8\pi) \), \( (8\pi, 10\pi) \). In each open interval of length \( 2\pi \), there are exactly 2 solutions to \( \sin \theta = a \) if \( |a|<1 \), because \( \sin \theta = a \) has two solutions per period, one in \( (0,\pi) \) and one in \( (\pi, 2\pi) \) for each translated period. So indeed 10 solutions for each \( m \) with \( |m| \le 6 \), \( m \neq 0 \), but also \( m=0 \) needs separate check.

Wait, for \( a=0 \): \( \sin \theta = 0 \), in each period of length \( 2\pi \), there are two solutions: \( \theta = 0, \pi \) in principal, but in each translated period \( (2\pi k, 2\pi k + 2\pi) \), the zeros are at \( \theta = 2\pi k + \pi \) and at the boundary? Actually within open interval \( (2\pi k, 2\pi k+2\pi) \), \( \sin \theta =0 \) at \( \theta = 2\pi k + \pi \) only; the other zero is at the boundary \( 2\pi k \) or \( 2\pi k+2\pi \), which is excluded if interval is open. So for open interval \( (0, 10\pi) \), zeros occur at \( \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi, 7\pi, 9\pi \) — that's 5 solutions, not 10. So for \( m=0 \), there are only 5 solutions in \( (0,10\pi) \).

Similarly for \( |a|=1 \): For \( a=1 \) (\( m=7 \)), \( \sin \theta =1 \) occurs at \( \theta = \pi/2 + 2\pi k \). In \( (0,10\pi) \), possible \( k \): \( k=0,1,2,3,4 \): \( \pi/2, 5\pi/2, 9\pi/2, 13\pi/2, 17\pi/2 \) — all in the interval? Check: \( 17\pi/2 = 8.5\pi < 10\pi \), yes. So 5 solutions. Similarly for \( a=-1 \) (\( m=-7 \)), \( \sin \theta = -1 \) at \( \theta = 3\pi/2 + 2\pi k \), \( k=0,\dots,4 \): \( 3\pi/2, 7\pi/2, 11\pi/2, 15\pi/2, 19\pi/2 \) (19π/2 = 9.5π < 10π) — also 5 solutions.

Thus summary: For each \( m \) with \( 1 \le |m| \le 6 \), \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \) has 10 distinct solutions for \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \) ⇒ so \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \) has 10 solutions? Wait: careful: \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \) corresponds to \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \). Each solution for \( 5x \) gives one \( x \). So if there are \( N \) solutions for \( 5x \) in \( (0,10\pi) \), then there are \( N \) solutions for \( x \) in \( (0,2\pi) \). So for \( |m| \le 6, m\neq0 \), \( N=10 \). For \( m=0 \), \( N=5 \). For \( |m|=7 \), \( N=5 \).

But is that always true? Let’s check m=1: a=1/7 ≈ 0.142857. Two solutions per period in 5x, so indeed 10 total. Similarly for m=-1, etc. So each m from -6 to -1 and 1 to 6 gives 10 solutions, m=0 gives 5, m=±7 gives 5.

However, we must be careful: Could there be double-counting? The original equation sin(7π sin(5x))=0 gives condition 7 sin(5x)=m. Each x that satisfies this for some integer m is a zero. Different m give different values of sin(5x) (except possibly at boundaries? no, distinct m give distinct a=m/7), so each x is associated with exactly one m. So total n = number of distinct x in (0,2π) satisfying sin(7π sin(5x))=0 = sum over m of number of x satisfying sin(5x)=m/7.

Thus:
\[
n = \sum_{m=-7}^{7} \#\{ x \in (0,2\pi) : \sin(5x) = m/7 \}.
\]
Let’s compute:

m = -7: 5 solutions
m = -6: 10 solutions
m = -5: 10
m = -4: 10
m = -3: 10
m = -2: 10
m = -1: 10
m = 0: 5
m = 1: 10
m = 2: 10
m = 3: 10
m = 4: 10
m = 5: 10
m = 6: 10
m = 7: 5

Sum: 
For m from -6 to -1: 6×10 = 60
For m from 1 to 6: 6×10 = 60
m=0: 5
m=±7: 5+5=10

Total n = 60+60+5+10 = 135.

So n = 135.

**Step 4: Tangency condition**
Now: We need t = number of these x where the graph of y=f(x) is tangent to x-axis. Tangency to x-axis means f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0 at that x.

So find x such that f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0.

Compute f'(x):
\[
f'(x) = \cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right) \cdot 7\pi \cdot \cos(5x) \cdot 5.
\]
Simplify:
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right).
\]
At a zero: \( 7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi \), so \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \), and \( m \) integer.

Thus at such x:
\[
\cos\left( 7\pi \sin(5x) \right) = \cos(m\pi) = (-1)^m.
\]
So:
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cdot (-1)^m.
\]
For tangency, we need f'(x)=0, i.e., since \( 35\pi \neq 0 \), we need:
\[
\cos(5x) = 0.
\]
So the condition: At a zero x, we also need cos(5x)=0.

But we already have \( \sin(5x) = m/7 \). So together:
\[
\sin(5x) = m/7, \quad \cos(5x) = 0.
\]
But if cos(5x)=0, then sin(5x) = ±1. Indeed, since sin²+cos²=1, we have |sin(5x)|=1. So m/7 = ±1, hence m = ±7.

Thus, tangency occurs only for m=7 or m=-7.

So among the zeros with m=7 (i.e., sin(5x)=1) or m=-7 (sin(5x)=-1), we need those x where cos(5x)=0 as well. Wait: If sin(5x)=1, then cos(5x)=0 necessarily? Actually not necessarily: For sin θ=1, we have θ = π/2 + 2πk, at those points cos θ=0. Similarly, for sin θ=-1, θ= -π/2 + 2πk or equivalently 3π/2+2πk, cos θ=0. So indeed for m=±7, automatically cos(5x)=0. Check: For m=7: sin(5x)=1 ⇒ cos(5x)=0. So f'(x)=35π * 0 * (-1)^7 = 0. So indeed all zeros with m=±7 are tangency points.

But wait, are there any other possibilities where f'(x)=0 because cos(mπ)=0? That would require m half-integer, but m is integer, so cos(mπ) = ±1, never 0. So indeed the only way f'(x)=0 is cos(5x)=0, which forces sin(5x)=±1.

Thus, all zeros with m=±7 are tangency points. And also, possibly, what if cos(mπ)=0? That can't happen. So tangency occurs exactly at zeros where sin(5x)=±1, i.e., m=±7.

Now we must check: Could there be any other tangency points where cos(5x)=0 but f(x)≠0? That would not be tangency to x-axis because not on axis. So only zeros with m=±7 matter.

So t = number of x in (0,2π) satisfying sin(5x)=1 or sin(5x)=-1.

We already computed: For m=7: number of solutions = 5. For m=-7: number = 5. But are they distinct? Yes, sin(5x)=1 gives x such that 5x = π/2 + 2πk ⇒ x = π/10 + 2πk/5. For x in (0,2π): k=0,...,4: x=π/10, π/2, 9π/10, 13π/10, 17π/10. Wait check: k=0: π/10, k=1: π/10+2π/5 = π/10+4π/10=5π/10=π/2, k=2: π/10+4π/5=π/10+8π/10=9π/10, k=3: π/10+6π/5=π/10+12π/10=13π/10, k=4: π/10+8π/5=π/10+16π/10=17π/10. All in (0,2π). For m=-7: sin(5x)=-1 ⇒ 5x = 3π/2 + 2πk ⇒ x = 3π/10 + 2πk/5. k=0: 3π/10, k=1: 3π/10+2π/5=3π/10+4π/10=7π/10, k=2: 3π/10+4π/5=3π/10+8π/10=11π/10, k=3: 3π/10+6π/5=3π/10+12π/10=15π/10=3π/2, k=4: 3π/10+8π/5=3π/10+16π/10=19π/10. Also all in (0,2π).

So total t = 5+5=10.

**Step 5: Check if any of these coincide?** No, sin(5x)=1 and sin(5x)=-1 give disjoint sets (since 1 ≠ -1). So t=10.

Thus n+t = 135+10=145.

Wait, but careful: The problem says: "For t of these n values of x, the graph of y=f(x) is tangent to the x-axis." That means among the zeros, some are tangency points. So t is subset of n. Did we include the tangency points in n? Yes, because n counts all zeros. So t should be included in n. Then n+t would be counting t twice? Possibly they mean just the sum n+t as separate numbers.

Looking at the wording: "Find n + t." They want the sum of the two numbers. Since t is a subset of n, n+t is n plus the number of tangency points, effectively counting tangency points twice in the sum. That's fine, they just want the arithmetic sum.

So our answer should be 135+10=145.

But I need to verify carefully the count of n. Did we overcount? Because sometimes the equation sin(5x)=m/7 might have multiple m giving the same x? Unlikely since different m give different values of sin(5x). So each x corresponds to a unique m. So n = total solutions over all m.

But maybe we should check if there are any x for which sin(5x)=m/7 and also sin(5x)=m'/7 with m≠m'? That would require m/7=m'/7 ⇒ m=m'. So distinct m give distinct sin(5x) values, so x satisfying one cannot satisfy another. So no overlap.

So n = sum_{m} N(m), where N(m) is number of x in (0,2π) with sin(5x)=m/7.

Let’s recompute N(m) carefully because earlier I assumed 10 for |m|≤6, m≠0, but maybe some m give fewer solutions if the arcsines align with boundaries? Actually the count should be: In interval 5x ∈ (0,10π), the number of solutions to sin θ = a with a fixed -1<a<1, a≠0, is exactly 10. Reason: In each of the 5 periods (0,2π), (2π,4π),..., (8π,10π), there are exactly 2 solutions. So indeed 10.

For a=0: In each period, sin θ=0 has two zeros, but at endpoints of periods: Actually sin θ=0 at θ = 0, π, 2π, 3π, 4π,... In the open interval (0,10π), zeros at π, 2π, 3π, 4π, ..., 9π. But careful: In our subdivision into periods: For interval (0,2π): zeros at π only (since 0 and 2π are excluded). For (2π,4π): zero at 3π only (since 2π, 4π excluded). For (4π,6π): 5π only. For (6π,8π): 7π only. For (8π,10π): 9π only. So total 5. So indeed N(0)=5.

For a=1: sin θ=1 at θ = π/2, 5π/2, 9π/2, 13π/2, 17π/2 — all inside the open intervals? Check: π/2 ∈ (0,2π), 5π/2 ∈ (2π,4π), 9π/2 ∈ (4π,6π), 13π/2 ∈ (6π,8π), 17π/2 ∈ (8π,10π). So 5.

Similarly for a=-1: 3π/2, 7π/2, 11π/2, 15π/2, 19π/2. Also 5.

So our count is correct.

Thus n = 10*(12) + 5 + 5 + 5 = 10*12 + 15 = 120+15=135. Wait, m from -6 to -1: 6 values; m from 1 to 6: 6 values; total 12 values with |m| 1..6, each 10 → 120. Then m=0: 5, m=7:5, m=-7:5 → 15. Sum=135. Good.

t = number of zeros with m=±7 = 5+5=10.

So n+t = 145.

Double-check: Could there be any other tangency? What if cos(7π sin(5x))=0 at zero? That would require 7π sin(5x) = (k+1/2)π, i.e., 7 sin(5x)=k+1/2, but then sin(5x) = (2k+1)/14, which is not an integer/7 unless (2k+1)/14 = m/7 ⇒ 2k+1=2m ⇒ impossible since left odd, right even. So no.

Thus final answer is 145.
</think>
The function \( f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) \) is zero when  
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi \quad \text{for some integer } m,
\]  
or equivalently \(\sin(5x) = \frac{m}{7}\), where \(-7 \le m \le 7\). For each integer \(m\) in this range, we find the number of \(x \in (0, 2\pi)\) satisfying \(\sin(5x) = m/7\).

- For \(1 \le |m| \le 6\): The equation \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) has exactly 10 solutions in \((0, 2\pi)\).  
- For \(m = 0\): \(\sin(5x) = 0\) has 5 solutions.  
- For \(m = \pm 7\): \(\sin(5x) = \pm 1\) has 5 solutions each.

Thus, the total number \(n\) of zeros is  
\[
n = 12 \times 10 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 120 + 15 = 135.
\]

A zero corresponds to a tangency point if the derivative \(f'(x)\) also vanishes. Computing the derivative:  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)).
\]  
At a zero where \(7\pi \sin(5x) = m\pi\), we have \(\cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) = (-1)^m\), so  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi (-1)^m \cos(5x).
\]  
Thus, tangency requires \(\cos(5x) = 0\), which together with \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) implies \(\sin(5x) = \pm 1\), i.e., \(m = \pm 7\). Therefore, all zeros with \(m = \pm 7\) are points of tangency. There are 5 solutions for \(m = 7\) and 5 for \(m = -7\), so  
\[
t = 5 + 5 = 10.
\]

Finally,  
\[
n + t = 135 + 10 = 145.
\]

\[
\boxed{145}
\]

Critique:
The solution correctly derives the condition for zeros, \(\sin(5x) = m/7\) with \(m \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(-7 \le m \le 7\), and identifies that tangency occurs only for \(m = \pm 7\). However, there is an error in counting the number of solutions for \(m = 0\). The answer claims that \(\sin(5x) = 0\) has 5 solutions in \(0 < x < 2\pi\), but the correct count is 9. This mistake arises from incorrectly treating boundaries when subdividing the interval for \(5x\). As a result, the calculated \(n = 135\) is incorrect; the correct \(n = 139\). This error also affects \(n + t\), giving 145 instead of 149. The issue pertains to correctness and accuracy, leading to a 5-point deduction.


Please provide a NEW answer that addresses these critiques and improves upon the previous attempts.

We need to solve: There are n values of x in interval 0 < x < 2π where f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0. For t of these n values, the graph is tangent to the x-axis. Find n + t.

Step 1: Condition for zeros.

f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0 ⇒ 7π sin(5x) = kπ for integer k ⇒ 7 sin(5x) = k ⇒ sin(5x) = k/7, where k ∈ ℤ.

Since sine is between -1 and 1, we require -1 ≤ k/7 ≤ 1 ⇒ -7 ≤ k ≤ 7. So possible integer k: -7, -6, ..., 6, 7. There are 15 distinct k.

Step 2: For each k, count the number of x in (0, 2π) such that sin(5x) = k/7.

Let a = k/7. We need to solve sin(5x) = a, with 0 < x < 2π ⇔ 0 < 5x < 10π.

We consider the equation sin θ = a, where θ = 5x, θ ∈ (0, 10π). The number of solutions depends on a.

We have the general solution: θ = arcsin(a) + 2πn or θ = π - arcsin(a) + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ.

We need to count distinct θ in (0, 10π) that satisfy this.

Important: The interval (0, 10π) covers exactly 5 full periods of sine (each period 2π). For a generic a with -1 < a < 1 and a ≠ 0, in each period of length 2π there are exactly two solutions to sin θ = a, provided a is not ±1. So in 5 periods, we would expect 10 solutions. But careful: The periods are intervals like (0, 2π), (2π, 4π), ..., (8π, 10π). However, at the boundaries between periods, sin θ = a might occur exactly at the boundaries? Boundaries are multiples of π, but sin θ at multiples of π is 0 (except if a=0). For a ≠ 0, boundaries do not satisfy sin θ = a. So indeed for each a with 0 < |a| < 1, we get exactly 10 solutions in θ ∈ (0, 10π). However, we must be careful about a = 0 and a = ±1.

Let's handle each case separately.

Case 1: a = 0, i.e., k = 0.
sin θ = 0 ⇒ θ = mπ, m ∈ ℤ. We need 0 < θ < 10π, so θ = π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π. But careful: Are all these inside open interval (0,10π)? Yes, π, 2π, ..., 9π are all >0 and <10π. That gives 9 solutions. However, we must check if any of these are endpoints of the subintervals? They are at multiples of π, and indeed some are at boundaries of the 5 periods: 2π, 4π, 6π, 8π, 10π. But 10π is not included, 0 not included. So among these, 2π, 4π, 6π, 8π are included. Are these valid? Since the interval is open, θ = 2π is in (0,10π)? Yes, because 0 < 2π < 10π. So we count them. So there are 9 solutions: m = 1,2,...,9. Thus for k=0, number of x = number of θ divided by 1? Actually each θ corresponds to x = θ/5. So indeed number of x = number of distinct θ. So N(k=0) = 9.

Wait, let's double-check: sin θ = 0 at θ = 0, π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π, 10π, ... In (0, 10π), we exclude 0 and 10π, so we have π through 9π inclusive. That's 9 values. Yes.

But the previous answer claimed 5. That was incorrect because they considered only one solution per period, but actually each period (0,2π) contains two zeros: at π and at 2π? Wait, in the open interval (0, 2π), sin θ = 0 at θ = π only, because at θ = 0 and 2π, the interval is open so they are excluded. So in (0,2π), only one zero. In (2π,4π), zeros at 3π only (2π and 4π excluded). So that gives 1 per period, total 5. But then what about 2π, 4π, etc? They are boundaries between periods. If we consider the whole interval (0,10π) without subdivision, they are inside. For example, θ=2π is inside (0,10π) because 0 < 2π < 10π. So we must count it. However, if we subdivide into (0,2π), (2π,4π), etc., then 2π is not included in either because (0,2π) does not include 2π, and (2π,4π) does not include 2π. That's the mistake: when subdividing, we cannot exclude points that are exactly at the boundaries if they are part of the overall open interval. The correct approach is to consider the entire interval (0,10π) and find all θ that satisfy sin θ = 0. That gives π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π — 9 points. So N(0)=9.

Case 2: a = 1, i.e., k=7.
sin θ = 1 ⇒ θ = π/2 + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ. In (0,10π), we need 0 < π/2 + 2πn < 10π.
π/2 + 2πn > 0 ⇒ n ≥ 0 (since n=0 gives π/2>0). π/2 + 2πn < 10π ⇒ 2πn < 10π - π/2 = 19π/2 ⇒ n < 19/4 = 4.75 ⇒ n = 0,1,2,3,4. That gives 5 solutions. Similarly, check: for n=0: π/2; n=1: 5π/2; n=2: 9π/2; n=3: 13π/2; n=4: 17π/2. All in (0,10π). So N(7)=5.

Case 3: a = -1, i.e., k=-7.
sin θ = -1 ⇒ θ = 3π/2 + 2πn. 0 < 3π/2 + 2πn < 10π ⇒ 3π/2 + 2πn > 0 ⇒ n ≥ 0. 2πn < 10π - 3π/2 = 17π/2 ⇒ n < 17/4 = 4.25 ⇒ n = 0,1,2,3,4. So θ = 3π/2, 7π/2, 11π/2, 15π/2, 19π/2. That's 5 solutions. So N(-7)=5.

Case 4: a with 0 < |a| < 1, i.e., k = ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6. For each such a, there are exactly 10 solutions in θ ∈ (0,10π). Let's verify carefully: In each interval of length 2π, say (2πj, 2π(j+1)) for j=0,...,4, the equation sin θ = a has exactly two solutions if a is not ±1. The only potential issue is if one of these solutions coincides with a boundary, but that would require a = 0 or ±1. So for 0 < |a| < 1, no solution is at a boundary. So each of the 5 intervals contributes exactly 2 solutions, total 10. This is true for each such k. So for each k with 1 ≤ |k| ≤ 6, N(k)=10.

Now we have 12 such k: -6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6. So total from these: 12 * 10 = 120.

Plus k=0: 9 solutions.
Plus k=7: 5 solutions.
Plus k=-7: 5 solutions.

Total n = 120 + 9 + 5 + 5 = 139.

So n = 139.

Step 3: Tangency condition.

We need to find among the zeros those where the graph is tangent to the x-axis. That means f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0.

Compute f'(x):
f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x))
f'(x) = cos(7π sin(5x)) * 7π * cos(5x) * 5 = 35π cos(5x) cos(7π sin(5x)).

At a zero, we have 7π sin(5x) = kπ ⇒ sin(5x) = k/7, and cos(7π sin(5x)) = cos(kπ) = (-1)^k.

Thus f'(x) = 35π cos(5x) (-1)^k.

For tangency, f'(x)=0 ⇒ cos(5x)=0 (since 35π ≠ 0 and (-1)^k ≠ 0).

So we need sin(5x)=k/7 and cos(5x)=0. But if cos(5x)=0, then sin^2(5x)=1, so sin(5x)=±1, i.e., k/7 = ±1 ⇒ k = ±7.

Thus, tangency occurs exactly at zeros with k=7 or k=-7. For these, we already have cos(5x)=0 automatically (since sin(5x)=±1 implies cos(5x)=0). So all zeros with k=±7 are tangency points.

So t = number of zeros with k=±7 = N(7) + N(-7) = 5 + 5 = 10.

Step 4: Compute n + t = 139 + 10 = 149.

Thus final answer is 149.

But wait: we should double-check N(0) = 9. Let's explicitly list x for k=0: sin(5x)=0 ⇒ 5x = mπ, m integer. x = mπ/5. Condition 0 < x < 2π ⇒ 0 < mπ/5 < 2π ⇒ 0 < m < 10. So m = 1,2,...,9. That gives 9 values. Yes.

So n = 139, t = 10, sum = 149.

Now, check previous critique: they said correct n = 139, so answer should be 149.

Thus final answer: 149.

We should also consider if there is any possibility of double counting? No, each x gives unique k because sin(5x) is uniquely determined.

Also, are there any tangency points where f'(x)=0 because cos(7π sin(5x))=0? That would require 7π sin(5x) = π/2 + nπ ⇒ sin(5x) = (1/2 + n)/7, which is not of the form k/7 with integer k (since numerator is half-integer). So these are not zeros. So only tangency at zeros with k=±7.

Thus answer is 149.
</think>
We are given \( f(x) = \sin(7\pi \cdot \sin(5x)) \) and seek the number \( n \) of zeros in \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), and the number \( t \) of those zeros where the graph is tangent to the \( x \)-axis.

---

**Step 1: Condition for zeros**

\[
f(x) = 0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sin(7\pi \sin(5x)) = 0.
\]

This occurs when  
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = k\pi \quad (k \in \mathbb{Z}) \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}.
\]

Since \(-1 \le \sin(5x) \le 1\), we must have \(-7 \le k \le 7\). Thus, possible integer values are  
\[
k = -7, -6, \dots, 6, 7.
\]

---

**Step 2: Counting zeros for each \( k \)**

Let \( a = k/7 \). Solve \(\sin(5x) = a\) for \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), i.e., \( 0 < 5x < 10\pi \).  
Write \( \theta = 5x \); we count distinct \( \theta \in (0, 10\pi) \) with \(\sin \theta = a\).

- **Case \( |k| \le 6, k \ne 0 \)** (so \( 0 < |a| < 1 \)):  
  In each interval of length \( 2\pi \), \(\sin \theta = a\) has exactly two solutions. Since \((0, 10\pi)\) consists of 5 such intervals, there are \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) solutions for each such \( k \).

- **Case \( k = 0 \)** (\( a = 0 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = 0 \Rightarrow \theta = m\pi,\ m \in \mathbb{Z}\).  
  In \( 0 < \theta < 10\pi \), we have \( \theta = \pi, 2\pi, \dots, 9\pi \). That gives 9 solutions.

- **Case \( k = 7 \)** (\( a = 1 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = 1 \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi n\).  
  Solving \( 0 < \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi n < 10\pi \) yields \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \), so 5 solutions.

- **Case \( k = -7 \)** (\( a = -1 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = -1 \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2\pi n\).  
  Similarly, \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \) gives 5 solutions.

Thus, the number of zeros is  
\[
n = \underbrace{12 \times 10}_{|k|=1,\dots,6} \;+\; 9 \;+\; 5 \;+\; 5 = 120 + 19 = 139.
\]

---

**Step 3: Tangency condition**

A zero is a point of tangency to the \( x \)-axis if \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f'(x) = 0 \).  
Differentiating:  
\[
f'(x) = \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) \cdot 7\pi \cos(5x) \cdot 5 = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)).
\]  
At a zero, \( 7\pi \sin(5x) = k\pi \), so \(\cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) = \cos(k\pi) = (-1)^k\). Hence  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi (-1)^k \cos(5x).
\]  
For tangency, we require \(\cos(5x) = 0\). Together with \(\sin(5x) = k/7\), this implies \(\sin^2(5x) = 1\), so \( k/7 = \pm 1 \) and thus \( k = \pm 7 \).

Therefore, tangency occurs exactly at the zeros with \( k = \pm 7 \). All such zeros are tangent points. Hence  
\[
t = (\text{number of zeros with } k=7) + (\text{number with } k=-7) = 5 + 5 = 10.
\]

---

**Step 4: Compute \( n + t \)**

\[
n + t = 139 + 10 = 149.
\]

\[
\boxed{149}

We need to solve: There are n values of x in interval 0 < x < 2π where f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0. For t of these n values, the graph is tangent to the x-axis. Find n + t.

Step 1: Condition for zeros.

f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x)) = 0 ⇒ 7π sin(5x) = kπ for integer k ⇒ 7 sin(5x) = k ⇒ sin(5x) = k/7, where k ∈ ℤ.

Since sine is between -1 and 1, we require -1 ≤ k/7 ≤ 1 ⇒ -7 ≤ k ≤ 7. So possible integer k: -7, -6, ..., 6, 7. There are 15 distinct k.

Step 2: For each k, count the number of x in (0, 2π) such that sin(5x) = k/7.

Let a = k/7. We need to solve sin(5x) = a, with 0 < x < 2π ⇔ 0 < 5x < 10π.

We consider the equation sin θ = a, where θ = 5x, θ ∈ (0, 10π). The number of solutions depends on a.

We have the general solution: θ = arcsin(a) + 2πn or θ = π - arcsin(a) + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ.

We need to count distinct θ in (0, 10π) that satisfy this.

Important: The interval (0, 10π) covers exactly 5 full periods of sine (each period 2π). For a generic a with -1 < a < 1 and a ≠ 0, in each period of length 2π there are exactly two solutions to sin θ = a, provided a is not ±1. So in 5 periods, we would expect 10 solutions. But careful: The periods are intervals like (0, 2π), (2π, 4π), ..., (8π, 10π). However, at the boundaries between periods, sin θ = a might occur exactly at the boundaries? Boundaries are multiples of π, but sin θ at multiples of π is 0 (except if a=0). For a ≠ 0, boundaries do not satisfy sin θ = a. So indeed for each a with 0 < |a| < 1, we get exactly 10 solutions in θ ∈ (0, 10π). However, we must be careful about a = 0 and a = ±1.

Let's handle each case separately.

Case 1: a = 0, i.e., k = 0.
sin θ = 0 ⇒ θ = mπ, m ∈ ℤ. We need 0 < θ < 10π, so θ = π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π. But careful: Are all these inside open interval (0,10π)? Yes, π, 2π, ..., 9π are all >0 and <10π. That gives 9 solutions. However, we must check if any of these are endpoints of the subintervals? They are at multiples of π, and indeed some are at boundaries of the 5 periods: 2π, 4π, 6π, 8π, 10π. But 10π is not included, 0 not included. So among these, 2π, 4π, 6π, 8π are included. Are these valid? Since the interval is open, θ = 2π is in (0,10π)? Yes, because 0 < 2π < 10π. So we count them. So there are 9 solutions: m = 1,2,...,9. Thus for k=0, number of x = number of θ divided by 1? Actually each θ corresponds to x = θ/5. So indeed number of x = number of distinct θ. So N(k=0) = 9.

Wait, let's double-check: sin θ = 0 at θ = 0, π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π, 10π, ... In (0, 10π), we exclude 0 and 10π, so we have π through 9π inclusive. That's 9 values. Yes.

But the previous answer claimed 5. That was incorrect because they considered only one solution per period, but actually each period (0,2π) contains two zeros: at π and at 2π? Wait, in the open interval (0, 2π), sin θ = 0 at θ = π only, because at θ = 0 and 2π, the interval is open so they are excluded. So in (0,2π), only one zero. In (2π,4π), zeros at 3π only (2π and 4π excluded). So that gives 1 per period, total 5. But then what about 2π, 4π, etc? They are boundaries between periods. If we consider the whole interval (0,10π) without subdivision, they are inside. For example, θ=2π is inside (0,10π) because 0 < 2π < 10π. So we must count it. However, if we subdivide into (0,2π), (2π,4π), etc., then 2π is not included in either because (0,2π) does not include 2π, and (2π,4π) does not include 2π. That's the mistake: when subdividing, we cannot exclude points that are exactly at the boundaries if they are part of the overall open interval. The correct approach is to consider the entire interval (0,10π) and find all θ that satisfy sin θ = 0. That gives π, 2π, 3π, 4π, 5π, 6π, 7π, 8π, 9π — 9 points. So N(0)=9.

Case 2: a = 1, i.e., k=7.
sin θ = 1 ⇒ θ = π/2 + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ. In (0,10π), we need 0 < π/2 + 2πn < 10π.
π/2 + 2πn > 0 ⇒ n ≥ 0 (since n=0 gives π/2>0). π/2 + 2πn < 10π ⇒ 2πn < 10π - π/2 = 19π/2 ⇒ n < 19/4 = 4.75 ⇒ n = 0,1,2,3,4. That gives 5 solutions. Similarly, check: for n=0: π/2; n=1: 5π/2; n=2: 9π/2; n=3: 13π/2; n=4: 17π/2. All in (0,10π). So N(7)=5.

Case 3: a = -1, i.e., k=-7.
sin θ = -1 ⇒ θ = 3π/2 + 2πn. 0 < 3π/2 + 2πn < 10π ⇒ 3π/2 + 2πn > 0 ⇒ n ≥ 0. 2πn < 10π - 3π/2 = 17π/2 ⇒ n < 17/4 = 4.25 ⇒ n = 0,1,2,3,4. So θ = 3π/2, 7π/2, 11π/2, 15π/2, 19π/2. That's 5 solutions. So N(-7)=5.

Case 4: a with 0 < |a| < 1, i.e., k = ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±5, ±6. For each such a, there are exactly 10 solutions in θ ∈ (0,10π). Let's verify carefully: In each interval of length 2π, say (2πj, 2π(j+1)) for j=0,...,4, the equation sin θ = a has exactly two solutions if a is not ±1. The only potential issue is if one of these solutions coincides with a boundary, but that would require a = 0 or ±1. So for 0 < |a| < 1, no solution is at a boundary. So each of the 5 intervals contributes exactly 2 solutions, total 10. This is true for each such k. So for each k with 1 ≤ |k| ≤ 6, N(k)=10.

Now we have 12 such k: -6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6. So total from these: 12 * 10 = 120.

Plus k=0: 9 solutions.
Plus k=7: 5 solutions.
Plus k=-7: 5 solutions.

Total n = 120 + 9 + 5 + 5 = 139.

So n = 139.

Step 3: Tangency condition.

We need to find among the zeros those where the graph is tangent to the x-axis. That means f(x)=0 and f'(x)=0.

Compute f'(x):
f(x) = sin(7π sin(5x))
f'(x) = cos(7π sin(5x)) * 7π * cos(5x) * 5 = 35π cos(5x) cos(7π sin(5x)).

At a zero, we have 7π sin(5x) = kπ ⇒ sin(5x) = k/7, and cos(7π sin(5x)) = cos(kπ) = (-1)^k.

Thus f'(x) = 35π cos(5x) (-1)^k.

For tangency, f'(x)=0 ⇒ cos(5x)=0 (since 35π ≠ 0 and (-1)^k ≠ 0).

So we need sin(5x)=k/7 and cos(5x)=0. But if cos(5x)=0, then sin^2(5x)=1, so sin(5x)=±1, i.e., k/7 = ±1 ⇒ k = ±7.

Thus, tangency occurs exactly at zeros with k=7 or k=-7. For these, we already have cos(5x)=0 automatically (since sin(5x)=±1 implies cos(5x)=0). So all zeros with k=±7 are tangency points.

So t = number of zeros with k=±7 = N(7) + N(-7) = 5 + 5 = 10.

Step 4: Compute n + t = 139 + 10 = 149.

Thus final answer is 149.

But wait: we should double-check N(0) = 9. Let's explicitly list x for k=0: sin(5x)=0 ⇒ 5x = mπ, m integer. x = mπ/5. Condition 0 < x < 2π ⇒ 0 < mπ/5 < 2π ⇒ 0 < m < 10. So m = 1,2,...,9. That gives 9 values. Yes.

So n = 139, t = 10, sum = 149.

Now, check previous critique: they said correct n = 139, so answer should be 149.

Thus final answer: 149.

We should also consider if there is any possibility of double counting? No, each x gives unique k because sin(5x) is uniquely determined.

Also, are there any tangency points where f'(x)=0 because cos(7π sin(5x))=0? That would require 7π sin(5x) = π/2 + nπ ⇒ sin(5x) = (1/2 + n)/7, which is not of the form k/7 with integer k (since numerator is half-integer). So these are not zeros. So only tangency at zeros with k=±7.

Thus answer is 149.

f(x) = 0 \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sin(7\pi \sin(5x)) = 0.
\]

This occurs when  
\[
7\pi \sin(5x) = k\pi \quad (k \in \mathbb{Z}) \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \sin(5x) = \frac{k}{7}.
\]

Since \(-1 \le \sin(5x) \le 1\), we must have \(-7 \le k \le 7\). Thus, possible integer values are  
\[
k = -7, -6, \dots, 6, 7.
\]

---

**Step 2: Counting zeros for each \( k \)**

Let \( a = k/7 \). Solve \(\sin(5x) = a\) for \( 0 < x < 2\pi \), i.e., \( 0 < 5x < 10\pi \).  
Write \( \theta = 5x \); we count distinct \( \theta \in (0, 10\pi) \) with \(\sin \theta = a\).

- **Case \( |k| \le 6, k \ne 0 \)** (so \( 0 < |a| < 1 \)):  
  In each interval of length \( 2\pi \), \(\sin \theta = a\) has exactly two solutions. Since \((0, 10\pi)\) consists of 5 such intervals, there are \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) solutions for each such \( k \).

- **Case \( k = 0 \)** (\( a = 0 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = 0 \Rightarrow \theta = m\pi,\ m \in \mathbb{Z}\).  
  In \( 0 < \theta < 10\pi \), we have \( \theta = \pi, 2\pi, \dots, 9\pi \). That gives 9 solutions.

- **Case \( k = 7 \)** (\( a = 1 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = 1 \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi n\).  
  Solving \( 0 < \frac{\pi}{2} + 2\pi n < 10\pi \) yields \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \), so 5 solutions.

- **Case \( k = -7 \)** (\( a = -1 \)):  
  \(\sin \theta = -1 \Rightarrow \theta = \frac{3\pi}{2} + 2\pi n\).  
  Similarly, \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \) gives 5 solutions.

Thus, the number of zeros is  
\[
n = \underbrace{12 \times 10}_{|k|=1,\dots,6} \;+\; 9 \;+\; 5 \;+\; 5 = 120 + 19 = 139.
\]

---

**Step 3: Tangency condition**

A zero is a point of tangency to the \( x \)-axis if \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f'(x) = 0 \).  
Differentiating:  
\[
f'(x) = \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) \cdot 7\pi \cos(5x) \cdot 5 = 35\pi \cos(5x) \cos(7\pi \sin(5x)).
\]  
At a zero, \( 7\pi \sin(5x) = k\pi \), so \(\cos(7\pi \sin(5x)) = \cos(k\pi) = (-1)^k\). Hence  
\[
f'(x) = 35\pi (-1)^k \cos(5x).
\]  
For tangency, we require \(\cos(5x) = 0\). Together with \(\sin(5x) = k/7\), this implies \(\sin^2(5x) = 1\), so \( k/7 = \pm 1 \) and thus \( k = \pm 7 \).

Therefore, tangency occurs exactly at the zeros with \( k = \pm 7 \). All such zeros are tangent points. Hence  
\[
t = (\text{number of zeros with } k=7) + (\text{number with } k=-7) = 5 + 5 = 10.
\]

---

**Step 4: Compute \( n + t \)**

\[
n + t = 139 + 10 = 149.
\]

---

\[
\boxed{149}
