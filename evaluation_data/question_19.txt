We are given a product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

It is written out explicitly as:

\[
\frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} \cdot \frac{\log_6(5^{35})}{\log_7(5^{32})} \cdots \frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})}
\]

We need to simplify this product and express it as a rational number m/n in lowest terms, then compute m+n.

Let's examine the general term for k from 4 to 63:

\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

Recall that \(\log_a(b^c) = c \log_a b\). Also note that \(\log_a b = \frac{1}{\log_b a}\). Alternatively, we can write logarithms with a common base. Let's use the change-of-base formula: \(\log_a b = \frac{\ln b}{\ln a}\).

So:

\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}.
\]

Similarly,

\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}.
\]

Therefore, the term becomes:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}}{(k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

So the product over k=4 to 63 is:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \left( \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right).
\]

Now, let's write this product separately:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product is a telescoping product in the logarithms:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]

So the product simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}.
\]

Now we need to evaluate \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). Note that \(\ln 64 = \ln (4^3) = 3 \ln 4\), so \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3\). So that part is just 3.

Thus the product is:

\[
3 \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}.
\]

Now we need to compute:

\[
P = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]

Write it out for a few terms to see if it telescopes.

Let's write P explicitly:

\[
P = \frac{(4-1)(4+1)}{(4-2)(4+2)} \cdot \frac{(5-1)(5+1)}{(5-2)(5+2)} \cdot \frac{(6-1)(6+1)}{(6-2)(6+2)} \cdots \frac{(63-1)(63+1)}{(63-2)(63+2)}.
\]

That is:

\[
P = \frac{3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 6} \cdot \frac{4 \cdot 6}{3 \cdot 7} \cdot \frac{5 \cdot 7}{4 \cdot 8} \cdot \frac{6 \cdot 8}{5 \cdot 9} \cdots \frac{62 \cdot 64}{61 \cdot 65}? 
\]

Wait careful: For k=4, we have (k-1)(k+1)/(k-2)(k+2) = 3*5/(2*6).
For k=5: 4*6/(3*7).
For k=6: 5*7/(4*8).
For k=7: 6*8/(5*9).
...
For k=63: (62)*(64)/(61)*(65)? Check: k=63: (63-1)=62, (63+1)=64, (63-2)=61, (63+2)=65. So yes, the last factor is (62*64)/(61*65).

So the product from k=4 to 63 is a telescoping product. Let's write it as:

Numerator factors: For each k, numerator contains (k-1) and (k+1).
Denominator factors: (k-2) and (k+2).

Now, as k runs from 4 to 63, (k-1) runs from 3 to 62. But note that (k-1) appears in numerator of the term for k, and also appears in denominator of the term for k+1? Actually, look at denominator: For a given k, denominator includes (k-2) and (k+2). So the cancellation pattern: 

Consider factor (k-1). It appears in numerator of term with index k. Does it appear anywhere in denominator? Possibly in denominator of term with index k+1? For term with index k+1, denominator includes ((k+1)-2) = (k-1). Yes! So (k-1) cancels between numerator of term k and denominator of term k+1, for k from 4 to 62. Similarly, factor (k+1) appears in numerator of term k, and might appear in denominator of term k-1? For term k-1, denominator includes ((k-1)+2) = (k+1). Yes! So (k+1) cancels between numerator of term k and denominator of term k-1, for k from 5 to 63.

Also, factors (k-2) and (k+2) appear in denominators, and likely have corresponding numerators from other terms.

Let's write the product in expanded form to see exactly which factors remain.

We have:

P = 
(3*5)/(2*6) * 
(4*6)/(3*7) * 
(5*7)/(4*8) * 
(6*8)/(5*9) *
... *
(61*63)/(60*64) *   (this is for k=62? Let's compute: for k=62: (62-1)(62+1)/(62-2)(62+2) = 61*63/60*64)
(62*64)/(61*65).   (this is for k=63)

So the product runs from k=4 to k=63. The pattern:

First term (k=4): 3*5 / (2*6)
Second (k=5): 4*6 / (3*7)
Third (k=6): 5*7 / (4*8)
Fourth (k=7): 6*8 / (5*9)
...
Second to last: For k=62: (61*63)/(60*64)
Last: For k=63: (62*64)/(61*65)

Now, multiply all numerators together and all denominators together.

Numerator overall product: 
3*5 * 4*6 * 5*7 * 6*8 * ... * 61*63 * 62*64.

We can group factors (k-1) and (k+1) separately. Actually, the numerator is product over k=4 to 63 of (k-1)(k+1) = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-1) * ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+1).

Similarly, denominator: product over k=4 to 63 of (k-2)(k+2) = ��_{k=4}^{63} (k-2) * ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+2).

Let's compute these products separately.

Let A = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-1). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k-1). That is exactly product from j=3 to 62 of j, where j = k-1. So A = 3 * 4 * 5 * ... * 62.

Let B = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+1). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k+1). That is product from j=5 to 64 of j, where j = k+1. So B = 5 * 6 * 7 * ... * 64.

So numerator = A * B = (3*4*5*...*62) * (5*6*...*64).

Denominator: C = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-2). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k-2) = product from j=2 to 61 of j (since j = k-2). So C = 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * 61.

D = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+2). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k+2) = product from j=6 to 65 of j (since j = k+2). So D = 6 * 7 * ... * 65.

So denominator = C * D = (2*3*4*...*61) * (6*7*...*65).

Then P = (A*B)/(C*D). We can cancel common factors.

Notice that A = 3*4*5*...*62. C = 2*3*4*...*61. So A/C = (3*4*...*62)/(2*3*...*61) = 62/2 = 31. Actually careful: 
A = 3*4*5*...*62.
C = 2*3*4*...*61.
So A/C = (3*4*...*62)/(2*3*...*61) = (62)/(2) = 31. Because all factors from 3 to 61 cancel, leaving 62/2 = 31.

Now B = 5*6*...*64.
D = 6*7*...*65.
So B/D = (5*6*...*64)/(6*7*...*65) = 5/65 = 1/13. Because all factors from 6 to 64 cancel, leaving 5/65 = 1/13.

Thus P = (A/C)*(B/D) = 31 * (1/13) = 31/13.

Wait, check: B = 5*6*...*64, D = 6*7*...*65. So indeed B/D = 5/65 = 1/13. Yes.

Thus the product P = 31/13.

Then the original product is 3 * P = 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

Now we need to check if 93/13 is in lowest terms. 93 = 3 * 31, 13 is prime, so gcd(93,13)=1. So m=93, n=13. Then m+n = 93+13 = 106.

But wait: Did we correctly compute the telescoping? Alternatively, we can notice the telescoping pattern directly:

Write P as:

P = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{k+1}{k+2}.

But careful: That factorization is not exactly two separate products because they share the index k. Actually we can separate:

P = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} \right).

Now, the first product: \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2}. Write terms: For k=4: 3/2; k=5: 4/3; k=6: 5/4; ...; k=63: 62/61. So product telescopes to (62/2) = 31.

The second product: \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = For k=4: 5/6; k=5: 6/7; ...; k=63: 64/65. So product telescopes to (5/65) = 1/13. Indeed, product = (5/6)*(6/7)*...*(64/65) = 5/65 = 1/13.

So P = 31 * (1/13) = 31/13. Same.

Thus the original product is 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

So m=93, n=13, m+n=106.

But is that the final answer? Let's double-check the problem statement: The product is given as equal to \(\frac{m}{n}\), relatively prime positive integers. We got 93/13. But maybe we made a mistake in the logarithm simplification? Let's re-check the first step.

Original term: \(\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}\). We rewrote as \(\frac{(k^2-1) \log_k 5}{(k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5}\). Then we used \(\log_k 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}\), \(\log_{k+1} 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}\). So indeed the \(\ln 5\) cancels, giving \(\frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}\). That seems correct.

Then product over k gives \(\prod \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}\). The second product telescopes from k=4 to 63: \(\frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). And \(\ln 64 = \ln(2^6) = 6 \ln 2\), \(\ln 4 = \ln(2^2) = 2 \ln 2\), so ratio = 3. Correct.

Now compute \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). That is indeed \(\frac{(4^2-1)(5^2-1)\cdots(63^2-1)}{(4^2-4)(5^2-4)\cdots(63^2-4)}\). We factored as difference of squares: \(k^2-1=(k-1)(k+1)\), \(k^2-4=(k-2)(k+2)\). So product becomes \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}\). And we telescoped it correctly. So answer seems to be 93/13, m+n=106.

But let's verify with a small example: If the product were from k=4 to, say, 5, then we would have:

\(\frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} = \frac{15 \log_4 5}{12 \log_5 5} \cdot \frac{24 \log_5 5}{21 \log_6 5} = \frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{24}{21} \cdot \frac{\log_4 5}{\log_6 5}\). And using change of base, \(\frac{\log_4 5}{\log_6 5} = \frac{\ln 5 / \ln 4}{\ln 5 / \ln 6} = \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). So product = \(\frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{24}{21} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). That equals \(\frac{15 \cdot 24}{12 \cdot 21} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4} = \frac{360}{252} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4} = \frac{10}{7} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). According to our formula, it should be \(3 \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{5} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). Compute that: For k=4: (16-1)/(16-4)=15/12=5/4, for k=5: (25-1)/(25-4)=24/21=8/7. So product of those two: (5/4)*(8/7)=40/28=10/7. Then times 3 gives 30/7. But we computed the product as (10/7)*(ln6/ln4). That is not equal to 30/7 unless ln6/ln4 = 3, which is false because ln6/ln4 ≈ 1.292. So there's a discrepancy. Wait, careful: In our derivation, we had the product equal to 3 times the product of the rational factors. But for the small case from k=4 to 5, the product should be:

According to our derived formula: The product from k=4 to N is: \(\frac{\ln(N+1)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{N} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). For N=5, ln(N+1)=ln6, so it's (ln6/ln4) * (15/12 * 24/21) = (ln6/ln4)*(10/7). That is not 3 * (10/7) because ln6/ln4 is not 3. In the full problem from k=4 to 63, we got ln64/ln4 = ln(4^3)/ln4 = 3. So indeed the factor becomes 3 only because 64 = 4^3. In the small case with N=5, ln6/ln4 is not an integer power. So our formula was: Product = \(\frac{\ln(64)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\) specifically because the upper limit is 63, so the last term in the logarithm product gives ln64. In general, the product from k=4 to N gives \(\frac{\ln(N+1)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{N} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). So we are correct for N=63, because ln64/ln4 = 3. So our answer should be correct.

Thus the product is 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

But wait: Let's check the product explicitly written in the problem: It starts with k=4 and ends with k=63. The last fraction is \(\frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})}\). For k=63, we have \(k^2-1 = 3969-1=3968\), and \(k^2-4=3969-4=3965\). So indeed k runs 4 to 63. And then the logarithm part telescopes to \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). But is it exactly \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\)? Let's check: The product of the logarithm ratios from k=4 to 63: \(\frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). So yes.

Now, note that \(\ln 64 / \ln 4 = \log_4 64 = \log_4 (4^3) = 3\). So that's fine.

So answer is 93/13, m+n=106.

But let's also compute the product \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\) carefully by telescoping the separate fractions as we did, but maybe there is another way: Write it as \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)/(k-2)}{(k+2)/(k+1)}\). Actually, \(\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)} = \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{k+1}{k+2}\). So product = (\(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2}\)) (\(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}\)) = (62/2) * (5/65) = 31 * 1/13 = 31/13. Yes.

So final product = 3 * 31/13 = 93/13.

Thus m=93, n=13, m+n=106.

We should check if the problem expects m+n, and whether the product is indeed m/n in lowest terms. 93/13 is already in lowest terms (13 is prime, 93 not divisible by 13). So answer is 106.

But wait: Could there be any simplification we missed? Possibly the logarithms could be simplified using base 5? Alternatively, we could compute directly using change-of-base to base 5.

Let’s try an alternative approach: Use base 5 logarithms.

We have: \(\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = \frac{k^2-1}{\log_5 k}\). Because \(\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = \frac{k^2-1}{\log_5 k}\).

Similarly, \(\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = \frac{k^2-4}{\log_5 (k+1)}\).

So the term becomes: \(\frac{(k^2-1)/\log_5 k}{(k^2-4)/\log_5 (k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\log_5 (k+1)}{\log_5 k}\).

Then the product over k becomes: \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_5 (k+1)}{\log_5 k} = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \right) \cdot \frac{\log_5 64}{\log_5 4}\).

And \(\frac{\log_5 64}{\log_5 4} = \log_4 64 = 3\). So same.

Thus consistent.

Therefore, the answer is 106.

I will answer: 106.

But let's write a complete explanation.

</think>
We simplify the product step by step.

The general term for \( k = 4, 5, \dots, 63 \) is
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}.
\]
Using the power rule and change-of-base formula,
\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k},
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln(k+1)}.
\]
Thus the term becomes
\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \ln 5 / \ln k}{(k^2-4) \ln 5 / \ln(k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The product over \( k = 4 \) to \( 63 \) factors as
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product telescopes:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]
Since \( 64 = 4^3 \), we have \( \ln 64 = 3 \ln 4 \), so \( \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3 \).

Now evaluate the first product:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]
Separate into two telescoping products:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}.
\]
The first product simplifies:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31.
\]
The second product simplifies:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}.
\]
Thus
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}.
\]

The original product is therefore
\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}.
\]

Since \( \gcd(93, 13) = 1 \), we have \( m = 93 \), \( n = 13 \), and
\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106.
\]

\boxed{106}

We are given a product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

It is written out explicitly as:

\[
\frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} \cdot \frac{\log_6(5^{35})}{\log_7(5^{32})} \cdots \frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})}
\]

We need to simplify this product and express it as a rational number m/n in lowest terms, then compute m+n.

Let's examine the general term for k from 4 to 63:

\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

Recall that \(\log_a(b^c) = c \log_a b\). Also note that \(\log_a b = \frac{1}{\log_b a}\). Alternatively, we can write logarithms with a common base. Let's use the change-of-base formula: \(\log_a b = \frac{\ln b}{\ln a}\).

So:

\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}.
\]

Similarly,

\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}.
\]

Therefore, the term becomes:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}}{(k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

So the product over k=4 to 63 is:

[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \left( \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right).
\]

Now, let's write this product separately:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product is a telescoping product in the logarithms:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]

So the product simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}.
\]

Now we need to evaluate \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). Note that \(\ln 64 = \ln (4^3) = 3 \ln 4\), so \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3\). So that part is just 3.

Thus the product is:

\[
3 \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}.
\]

Now we need to compute:

\[
P = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]

Write it out for a few terms to see if it telescopes.

Let's write P explicitly:

\[
P = \frac{(4-1)(4+1)}{(4-2)(4+2)} \cdot \frac{(5-1)(5+1)}{(5-2)(5+2)} \cdot \frac

That is:

\]

Wait careful: For k=4, we have (k-1)(k+1)/(k-2)(k+2) = 3*5/(2*6).
For k=5: 4*6/(3*7).
For k=6: 5*7/(4*8).
For k=7: 6*8/(5*9).
...
For k=63: (62)*(64)/(61)*(65)? Check: k=63: (63-1)=62, (63+1)=64, (63-2)=61, (63+2)=65. So yes, the last factor is (62*64)/(61*65).

So the product from k=4 to 63 is a telescoping product. Let's write it as:

Numerator factors: For each k, numerator contains (k-1) and (k+1).
Denominator factors: (k-2) and (k+2).

Now, as k runs from 4 to 63, (k-1) runs from 3 to 62. But note that (k-1) appears in numerator of the term for k, and also appears in denominator of the term for k+1? Actually, look at denominator: For a given k, denominator includes (k-2) and (k+2). So the cancellation pattern: 

Consider factor (k-1). It appears in numerator of term with index k. Does it appear anywhere in denominator? Possibly in denominator of term with index k+1? For term with index k+1, denominator includes ((k+1)-2) = (k-1). Yes! So (k-1) cancels between numerator of term k and denominator of term k+1, for k from 4 to

 62. Similarly, factor (k+1) appears in numerator of term k, and might appear in denominator of term k-1? For term k-1, denominator includes ((k-1)+2) = (k+1). Yes! So (k+1) cancels between numerator of term k and denominator of term k-1, for k from 5 to 63.

Also, factors (k-2) and (k+2) appear in denominators, and likely have corresponding numerators from other terms.

Let's write the product in expanded form to see exactly which factors remain.

We have:

P = 
(3*5)/(2*6) * 
(4*6)/(3*7) * 
(5*7)/(4*8) * 
(6*8)/(5*9) *
... *
(61*63)/(60*64) *   (this is for k=62? Let's compute: for k=62: (62-1)(62+1)/(62-2)(62+2) = 61*63/60*64)
(62*64)/(61*65).   (this is for k=63)

So the product runs from k=4 to k=63. The pattern:

First term (k=4): 3*5 / (2*6)
Second (k=5): 4*6 / (3*7)
Third (k=6): 5*7 / (4*8)
Fourth (k=7): 6*8 / (5*9)
...
Second to last: For k=62: (61*63)/(60*64)
Last: For k=63: (62*64)/(61*65)

Now, multiply all numerators together and all denominators together.

Numerator overall product: 
3*5 * 4*6 * 5*7 * 6*8 * ... * 61*63 * 62*64.

We can group factors (k-1) and (k+1) separately. Actually, the numerator is product over k=4 to 63 of (k-1)(k+1) = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-1) * ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+1).

Similarly, denominator: product over k=4 to 63 of (k-2)(k+2) = �

�_{k=4}^{63} (k-2) * ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+2).

Let's compute these products separately.

Let A = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-1). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k-1). That is exactly product from j=3 to 62 of j, where j = k-1. So A = 3 * 4 * 5 * ... * 62.

Let B = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+1). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k+1). That is product from j=5 to 64 of j, where j = k+1. So B = 5 * 6 * 7 * ... * 64.

So numerator = A * B = (3*4*5*...*62) * (5*6*...*64).

Denominator: C = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-2). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k-2) = product from j=2 to 61 of j (since j = k-2). So C = 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * 61.

D = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+2). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k+2) = product from j=6 to 65 of j (since j = k+2). So D = 6 * 7 * ... * 65.

So denominator = C * D = (2*3*4*...*61) * (6*7*...*65).

Then P = (A*B)/(C*D). We can cancel common factors.

Notice that A = 3*4*5*...*62. C = 2*3*4*...*61. So A/C = (3*4*...*62)/(2*3*...*61) = 62/2 = 31. Actually careful: 
A = 3*4*5*...*62.
C = 2*3*4*...*61.
So A/C = (3*4*...*62)/(2*3*...*61) = (62)/(2) = 31. Because all factors

 from 3 to 61 cancel, leaving 62/2 = 31.

Now B = 5*6*...*64.
D = 6*7*...*65.
So B/D = (5*6*...*64)/(6*7*...*65) = 5/65 = 1/13. Because all factors from 6 to 64 cancel, leaving 5/65 = 1/13.

Thus P = (A/C)*(B/D) = 31 * (1/13) = 31/13.

Wait, check: B = 5*6*...*64, D = 6*7*...*65. So indeed B/D = 5/65 = 1/13. Yes.

Thus the product P = 31/13.

Then the original product is 3 * P = 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

Now we need to check if 93/13 is in lowest terms. 93 = 3 * 31, 13 is prime, so gcd(93,13)=1. So m=93, n=13. Then m+n = 93+13 = 106.

But wait: Did we correctly compute the telescoping? Alternatively, we can notice the telescoping pattern directly:

Write P as:

P = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{k+1}{k+2}.

But careful: That factorization is not exactly two separate products because they share the index k. Actually we can separate:

P = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} \right).

Now, the first product: \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2}. Write terms: For k=4: 3/2; k=5: 4/3; k=6: 5/4; ...; k=63:

62/61. So product telescopes to (62/2) = 31.

The second product: \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = For k=4: 5/6; k=5: 6/7; ...; k=63: 64/65. So product telescopes to (5/65) = 1/13. Indeed, product = (5/6)*(6/7)*...*(64/65) = 5/65 = 1/13.

So P = 31 * (1/13) = 31/13. Same.

Thus the original product is 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

So m=93, n=13, m+n=106.

But is that the final answer? Let's double-check the problem statement: The product is given as equal to \(\frac{m}{n}\), relatively prime positive integers. We got 93/13. But maybe we made a mistake in the logarithm simplification? Let's re-check the first step.

Original term: \(\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}\). We rewrote as \(\frac{(k^2-1) \log_k 5}{(k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5}\). Then we used \(\log_k 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}\), \(\log_{k+1} 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}\). So indeed the \(\ln 5\) cancels, giving \(\frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}\). That seems correct.

Then product over k gives \(\prod \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}\). The second product telescopes from k=4 to 63: \(\frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\

). And \(\ln 64 = \ln(2^6) = 6 \ln 2\), \(\ln 4 = \ln(2^2) = 2 \ln 2\), so ratio = 3. Correct.

Now compute \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). That is indeed \(\frac{(4^2-1)(5^2-1)\cdots(63^2-1)}{(4^2-4)(5^2-4)\cdots(63^2-4)}\). We factored as difference of squares: \(k^2-1=(k-1)(k+1)\), \(k^2-4=(k-2)(k+2)\). So product becomes \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}\). And we telescoped it correctly. So answer seems to be 93/13, m+n=106.

But let's verify with a small example: If the product were from k=4 to, say, 5, then we would have:

\(\frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} = \frac{15 \log_4 5}{12 \log_5 5} \cdot \frac{24 \log_5 5}{21 \log_6 5} = \frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{24}{21} \cdot \frac{\log_4 5}{\log_6 5}\). And using change of base, \(\frac{\log_4 5}{\log_6 5} = \frac{\ln 5 / \ln 4}{\ln 5 / \ln 6} = \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). So product = \(\frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{24}{21} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). That equals \(\frac{15 \cdot 24}{12 \cdot 21} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}

 = \frac{360}{252} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4} = \frac{10}{7} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). According to our formula, it should be \(3 \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{5} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). Compute that: For k=4: (16-1)/(16-4)=15/12=5/4, for k=5: (25-1)/(25-4)=24/21=8/7. So product of those two: (5/4)*(8/7)=40/28=10/7. Then times 3 gives 30/7. But we computed the product as (10/7)*(ln6/ln4). That is not equal to 30/7 unless ln6/ln4 = 3, which is false because ln6/ln4 ≈ 1.292. So there's a discrepancy. Wait, careful: In our derivation, we had the product equal to 3 times the product of the rational factors. But for the small case from k=4 to 5, the product should be:

According to our derived formula: The product from k=4 to N is: \(\frac{\ln(N+1)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{N} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). For N=5, ln(N+1)=ln6, so it's (ln6/ln4) * (15/12 * 24/21) = (ln6/ln4)*(10/7). That is not 3 * (10/7) because ln6/ln4 is not 3. In the full problem from k=4 to 63, we got ln64/ln4 = ln(4^3)/ln4 = 3. So indeed the factor becomes 3 only because 64 = 4^3. In the small case with N=5, ln6/ln4 is not an integer power. So our formula was: Product = \(\frac{\ln(64)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\) specifically because the upper limit is 63,

 so the last term in the logarithm product gives ln64. In general, the product from k=4 to N gives \(\frac{\ln(N+1)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{N} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). So we are correct for N=63, because ln64/ln4 = 3. So our answer should be correct.

Thus the product is 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

But wait: Let's check the product explicitly written in the problem: It starts with k=4 and ends with k=63. The last fraction is \(\frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})}\). For k=63, we have \(k^2-1 = 3969-1=3968\), and \(k^2-4=3969-4=3965\). So indeed k runs 4 to 63. And then the logarithm part telescopes to \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). But is it exactly \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\)? Let's check: The product of the logarithm ratios from k=4 to 63: \(\frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). So yes.

Now, note that \(\ln 64 / \ln 4 = \log_4 64 = \log_4 (4^3) = 3\). So that's fine.

So answer is 93/13, m+n=106.

But let's also compute the product \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\) carefully by telescoping the separate fractions as we did, but maybe there is another way: Write it as \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)/(k-2)}{(k+2)/(k+1)}\). Actually, \(\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)} = \frac{k-1}{k-2}

 \cdot \frac{k+1}{k+2}\). So product = (\(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2}\)) (\(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}\)) = (62/2) * (5/65) = 31 * 1/13 = 31/13. Yes.

So final product = 3 * 31/13 = 93/13.

Thus m=93, n=13, m+n=106.

We should check if the problem expects m+n, and whether the product is indeed m/n in lowest terms. 93/13 is already in lowest terms (13 is prime, 93 not divisible by 13). So answer is 106.

But wait: Could there be any simplification we missed? Possibly the logarithms could be simplified using base 5? Alternatively, we could compute directly using change-of-base to base 5.

Let’s try an alternative approach: Use base 5 logarithms.

We have: \(\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = \frac{k^2-1}{\log_5 k}\). Because \(\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = \frac{k^2-1}{\log_5 k}\).

Similarly, \(\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = \frac{k^2-4}{\log_5 (k+1)}\).

So the term becomes: \(\frac{(k^2-1)/\log_5 k}{(k^2-4)/\log_5 (k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\log_5 (k+1)}{\log_5 k}\).

Then the product over k becomes: \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_5 (k+1)}{\log_5 k} = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \right) \cdot \frac{\log_5 64}{\log

_5 4}\).

And \(\frac{\log_5 64}{\log_5 4} = \log_4 64 = 3\). So same.

Thus consistent.

Therefore, the answer is 106.

I will answer: 106.

But let's write a complete explanation.

</think>
We simplify the product step by step.

The general term for \( k = 4, 5, \dots, 63 \) is
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}.
\]
Using the power rule and change-of-base formula,
\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k},
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln(k+1)}.
\]
Thus the term becomes
\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \ln 5 / \ln k}{(k^2-4) \ln 5 / \ln(k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The product over \( k = 4 \) to \( 63 \) factors as
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product telescopes:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]
Since \( 64 = 4^3 \), we have \( \ln 64 = 3 \ln 4 \), so \( \frac

{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3 \).

Now evaluate the first product:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]
Separate into two telescoping products:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}.
\]
The first product simplifies:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31.
\]
The second product simplifies:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}.
\]
Thus
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}.
\]

The original product is therefore
\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}.
\]

Since \( \gcd(93, 13) = 1 \), we have \( m = 93 \), \( n = 13 \), and
\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106.
\]

\boxed{106}

The product is given as:

We need to express it as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) in lowest terms, then find \(m+n\).

Let me simplify step by step.

**Step 1: Simplify each term**

For a given \(k\):

\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5
\]

So the term becomes:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \log_k 5}{(k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5}
\]

**Step 2: Use change of base to express in terms of natural logs (or any common base)**

\[
\log_k 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}, \quad \log_{k+1} 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}}{(k^2-4) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}
\]

**Step 3: Write the product from \(k=4\) to \(63\)**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \left( \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right) = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4

\]

**Step 4: Telescope the logarithm product**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}
\]

Since \(64 = 4^3\), \(\ln 64 = 3 \ln 4\), so:

\[
\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3
\]

**Step 5: Simplify the product of the rational parts**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}
\]

We can separate this into two products:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}
\]

Now telescope each:

- For the first product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31
\]

- For the second product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}
\]

Thus:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{

\]

**Step 6: Combine the results**

The original product is:

\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}
\]

**Step 7: Check if \(\frac{93}{13}\) is in lowest terms**

\(93 = 3 \times 31\), and \(13\) is prime, so \(\gcd(93, 13) = 1\). Thus \(m = 93\), \(n = 13\), and:

\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106
\]

I'll present the answer as \(\boxed{106}\).

</think>

We simplify the product step by step.

For each \(k\) from \(4\) to \(63\), the general term is
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}.
\]
Using the power rule for logarithms and the change-of-base formula,
\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1)\log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k},
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4)\log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln(k+1)}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})} = \frac{(k^2-1) \ln 5 / \ln k}{(k^2-4) \ln 5 / \ln(k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The product over \(k=4\) to \(63\) factors as
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product telescopes:
\[
\prod_{k=4

\]
Since \(64 = 4^3\), \(\ln 64 = 3 \ln 4\), so \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3\).

Now evaluate the first product:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]
Separate into two telescoping products:
\[
\left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} \right).
\]
Compute each:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31,
\]
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}.
\]

The original product is therefore
\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}.
\]

Since \(\gcd(93,13) = 1\), we have \(m = 93

评论:
The provided answer is thorough and accurate. Each step is logically justified: the logarithm terms are simplified using power and change-of-base rules, the product is separated into telescoping components, and each telescoping product is correctly evaluated. The final fraction \(\frac{93}{13}\) is in lowest terms, and the sum \(m+n=106\) is correctly computed. The reasoning is clear, complete, and free of errors or omissions. No issues requiring deduction are identified.

[2026-02-25 17:34:43] [DEBUG] 生成的完整 answer:
We are given a product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

It is written out explicitly as:

\[
\frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} \cdot \frac{\log_6(5^{35})}{\log_7(5^{32})} \cdots \frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})}
\]

We need to simplify this product and express it as a rational number m/n in lowest terms, then compute m+n.

Let's examine the general term for k from 4 to 63:

\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

Recall that \(\log_a(b^c) = c \log_a b\). Also note that \(\log_a b = \frac{1}{\log_b a}\). Alternatively, we can write logarithms with a common base. Let's use the change-of-base formula: \(\log_a b = \frac{\ln b}{\ln a}\).

So:

\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}.
\]

Similarly,

\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}.
\]

Therefore, the term becomes:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}}{(k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

So the product over k=4 to 63 is:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \left( \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right).
\]

Now, let's write this product separately:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product is a telescoping product in the logarithms:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]

So the product simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}.
\]

Now we need to evaluate \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). Note that \(\ln 64 = \ln (4^3) = 3 \ln 4\), so \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3\). So that part is just 3.

Thus the product is:

\[
3 \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}.
\]

Now we need to compute:

\[
P = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]

Write it out for a few terms to see if it telescopes.

Let's write P explicitly:

\[
P = \frac{(4-1)(4+1)}{(4-2)(4+2)} \cdot \frac{(5-1)(5+1)}{(5-2)(5+2)} \cdot \frac{(6-1)(6+1)}{(6-2)(6+2)} \cdots \frac{(63-1)(63+1)}{(63-2)(63+2)}.
\]

That is:

\[
P = \frac{3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 6} \cdot \frac{4 \cdot 6}{3 \cdot 7} \cdot \frac{5 \cdot 7}{4 \cdot 8} \cdot \frac{6 \cdot 8}{5 \cdot 9} \cdots \frac{62 \cdot 64}{61 \cdot 65}? 
\]

Wait careful: For k=4, we have (k-1)(k+1)/(k-2)(k+2) = 3*5/(2*6).
For k=5: 4*6/(3*7).
For k=6: 5*7/(4*8).
For k=7: 6*8/(5*9).
...
For k=63: (62)*(64)/(61)*(65)? Check: k=63: (63-1)=62, (63+1)=64, (63-2)=61, (63+2)=65. So yes, the last factor is (62*64)/(61*65).

So the product from k=4 to 63 is a telescoping product. Let's write it as:

Numerator factors: For each k, numerator contains (k-1) and (k+1).
Denominator factors: (k-2) and (k+2).

Now, as k runs from 4 to 63, (k-1) runs from 3 to 62. But note that (k-1) appears in numerator of the term for k, and also appears in denominator of the term for k+1? Actually, look at denominator: For a given k, denominator includes (k-2) and (k+2). So the cancellation pattern: 

Consider factor (k-1). It appears in numerator of term with index k. Does it appear anywhere in denominator? Possibly in denominator of term with index k+1? For term with index k+1, denominator includes ((k+1)-2) = (k-1). Yes! So (k-1) cancels between numerator of term k and denominator of term k+1, for k from 4 to 62. Similarly, factor (k+1) appears in numerator of term k, and might appear in denominator of term k-1? For term k-1, denominator includes ((k-1)+2) = (k+1). Yes! So (k+1) cancels between numerator of term k and denominator of term k-1, for k from 5 to 63.

Also, factors (k-2) and (k+2) appear in denominators, and likely have corresponding numerators from other terms.

Let's write the product in expanded form to see exactly which factors remain.

We have:

P = 
(3*5)/(2*6) * 
(4*6)/(3*7) * 
(5*7)/(4*8) * 
(6*8)/(5*9) *
... *
(61*63)/(60*64) *   (this is for k=62? Let's compute: for k=62: (62-1)(62+1)/(62-2)(62+2) = 61*63/60*64)
(62*64)/(61*65).   (this is for k=63)

So the product runs from k=4 to k=63. The pattern:

First term (k=4): 3*5 / (2*6)
Second (k=5): 4*6 / (3*7)
Third (k=6): 5*7 / (4*8)
Fourth (k=7): 6*8 / (5*9)
...
Second to last: For k=62: (61*63)/(60*64)
Last: For k=63: (62*64)/(61*65)

Now, multiply all numerators together and all denominators together.

Numerator overall product: 
3*5 * 4*6 * 5*7 * 6*8 * ... * 61*63 * 62*64.

We can group factors (k-1) and (k+1) separately. Actually, the numerator is product over k=4 to 63 of (k-1)(k+1) = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-1) * ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+1).

Similarly, denominator: product over k=4 to 63 of (k-2)(k+2) = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-2) * ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+2).

Let's compute these products separately.

Let A = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-1). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k-1). That is exactly product from j=3 to 62 of j, where j = k-1. So A = 3 * 4 * 5 * ... * 62.

Let B = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+1). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k+1). That is product from j=5 to 64 of j, where j = k+1. So B = 5 * 6 * 7 * ... * 64.

So numerator = A * B = (3*4*5*...*62) * (5*6*...*64).

Denominator: C = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-2). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k-2) = product from j=2 to 61 of j (since j = k-2). So C = 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * 61.

D = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+2). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k+2) = product from j=6 to 65 of j (since j = k+2). So D = 6 * 7 * ... * 65.

So denominator = C * D = (2*3*4*...*61) * (6*7*...*65).

Then P = (A*B)/(C*D). We can cancel common factors.

Notice that A = 3*4*5*...*62. C = 2*3*4*...*61. So A/C = (3*4*...*62)/(2*3*...*61) = 62/2 = 31. Actually careful: 
A = 3*4*5*...*62.
C = 2*3*4*...*61.
So A/C = (3*4*...*62)/(2*3*...*61) = (62)/(2) = 31. Because all factors from 3 to 61 cancel, leaving 62/2 = 31.

Now B = 5*6*...*64.
D = 6*7*...*65.
So B/D = (5*6*...*64)/(6*7*...*65) = 5/65 = 1/13. Because all factors from 6 to 64 cancel, leaving 5/65 = 1/13.

Thus P = (A/C)*(B/D) = 31 * (1/13) = 31/13.

Wait, check: B = 5*6*...*64, D = 6*7*...*65. So indeed B/D = 5/65 = 1/13. Yes.

Thus the product P = 31/13.

Then the original product is 3 * P = 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

Now we need to check if 93/13 is in lowest terms. 93 = 3 * 31, 13 is prime, so gcd(93,13)=1. So m=93, n=13. Then m+n = 93+13 = 106.

But wait: Did we correctly compute the telescoping? Alternatively, we can notice the telescoping pattern directly:

Write P as:

P = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{k+1}{k+2}.

But careful: That factorization is not exactly two separate products because they share the index k. Actually we can separate:

P = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} \right).

Now, the first product: \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2}. Write terms: For k=4: 3/2; k=5: 4/3; k=6: 5/4; ...; k=63: 62/61. So product telescopes to (62/2) = 31.

The second product: \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = For k=4: 5/6; k=5: 6/7; ...; k=63: 64/65. So product telescopes to (5/65) = 1/13. Indeed, product = (5/6)*(6/7)*...*(64/65) = 5/65 = 1/13.

So P = 31 * (1/13) = 31/13. Same.

Thus the original product is 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

So m=93, n=13, m+n=106.

But is that the final answer? Let's double-check the problem statement: The product is given as equal to \(\frac{m}{n}\), relatively prime positive integers. We got 93/13. But maybe we made a mistake in the logarithm simplification? Let's re-check the first step.

Original term: \(\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}\). We rewrote as \(\frac{(k^2-1) \log_k 5}{(k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5}\). Then we used \(\log_k 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}\), \(\log_{k+1} 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}\). So indeed the \(\ln 5\) cancels, giving \(\frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}\). That seems correct.

Then product over k gives \(\prod \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}\). The second product telescopes from k=4 to 63: \(\frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). And \(\ln 64 = \ln(2^6) = 6 \ln 2\), \(\ln 4 = \ln(2^2) = 2 \ln 2\), so ratio = 3. Correct.

Now compute \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). That is indeed \(\frac{(4^2-1)(5^2-1)\cdots(63^2-1)}{(4^2-4)(5^2-4)\cdots(63^2-4)}\). We factored as difference of squares: \(k^2-1=(k-1)(k+1)\), \(k^2-4=(k-2)(k+2)\). So product becomes \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}\). And we telescoped it correctly. So answer seems to be 93/13, m+n=106.

But let's verify with a small example: If the product were from k=4 to, say, 5, then we would have:

\(\frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} = \frac{15 \log_4 5}{12 \log_5 5} \cdot \frac{24 \log_5 5}{21 \log_6 5} = \frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{24}{21} \cdot \frac{\log_4 5}{\log_6 5}\). And using change of base, \(\frac{\log_4 5}{\log_6 5} = \frac{\ln 5 / \ln 4}{\ln 5 / \ln 6} = \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). So product = \(\frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{24}{21} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). That equals \(\frac{15 \cdot 24}{12 \cdot 21} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4} = \frac{360}{252} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4} = \frac{10}{7} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). According to our formula, it should be \(3 \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{5} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). Compute that: For k=4: (16-1)/(16-4)=15/12=5/4, for k=5: (25-1)/(25-4)=24/21=8/7. So product of those two: (5/4)*(8/7)=40/28=10/7. Then times 3 gives 30/7. But we computed the product as (10/7)*(ln6/ln4). That is not equal to 30/7 unless ln6/ln4 = 3, which is false because ln6/ln4 ≈ 1.292. So there's a discrepancy. Wait, careful: In our derivation, we had the product equal to 3 times the product of the rational factors. But for the small case from k=4 to 5, the product should be:

According to our derived formula: The product from k=4 to N is: \(\frac{\ln(N+1)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{N} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). For N=5, ln(N+1)=ln6, so it's (ln6/ln4) * (15/12 * 24/21) = (ln6/ln4)*(10/7). That is not 3 * (10/7) because ln6/ln4 is not 3. In the full problem from k=4 to 63, we got ln64/ln4 = ln(4^3)/ln4 = 3. So indeed the factor becomes 3 only because 64 = 4^3. In the small case with N=5, ln6/ln4 is not an integer power. So our formula was: Product = \(\frac{\ln(64)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\) specifically because the upper limit is 63, so the last term in the logarithm product gives ln64. In general, the product from k=4 to N gives \(\frac{\ln(N+1)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{N} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). So we are correct for N=63, because ln64/ln4 = 3. So our answer should be correct.

Thus the product is 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

But wait: Let's check the product explicitly written in the problem: It starts with k=4 and ends with k=63. The last fraction is \(\frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})}\). For k=63, we have \(k^2-1 = 3969-1=3968\), and \(k^2-4=3969-4=3965\). So indeed k runs 4 to 63. And then the logarithm part telescopes to \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). But is it exactly \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\)? Let's check: The product of the logarithm ratios from k=4 to 63: \(\frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). So yes.

Now, note that \(\ln 64 / \ln 4 = \log_4 64 = \log_4 (4^3) = 3\). So that's fine.

So answer is 93/13, m+n=106.

But let's also compute the product \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\) carefully by telescoping the separate fractions as we did, but maybe there is another way: Write it as \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)/(k-2)}{(k+2)/(k+1)}\). Actually, \(\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)} = \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{k+1}{k+2}\). So product = (\(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2}\)) (\(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}\)) = (62/2) * (5/65) = 31 * 1/13 = 31/13. Yes.

So final product = 3 * 31/13 = 93/13.

Thus m=93, n=13, m+n=106.

We should check if the problem expects m+n, and whether the product is indeed m/n in lowest terms. 93/13 is already in lowest terms (13 is prime, 93 not divisible by 13). So answer is 106.

But wait: Could there be any simplification we missed? Possibly the logarithms could be simplified using base 5? Alternatively, we could compute directly using change-of-base to base 5.

Let’s try an alternative approach: Use base 5 logarithms.

We have: \(\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = \frac{k^2-1}{\log_5 k}\). Because \(\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = \frac{k^2-1}{\log_5 k}\).

Similarly, \(\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = \frac{k^2-4}{\log_5 (k+1)}\).

So the term becomes: \(\frac{(k^2-1)/\log_5 k}{(k^2-4)/\log_5 (k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\log_5 (k+1)}{\log_5 k}\).

Then the product over k becomes: \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_5 (k+1)}{\log_5 k} = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \right) \cdot \frac{\log_5 64}{\log_5 4}\).

And \(\frac{\log_5 64}{\log_5 4} = \log_4 64 = 3\). So same.

Thus consistent.

Therefore, the answer is 106.

I will answer: 106.

But let's write a complete explanation.

</think>
We simplify the product step by step.

The general term for \( k = 4, 5, \dots, 63 \) is
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}.
\]
Using the power rule and change-of-base formula,
\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k},
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln(k+1)}.
\]
Thus the term becomes
\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \ln 5 / \ln k}{(k^2-4) \ln 5 / \ln(k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The product over \( k = 4 \) to \( 63 \) factors as
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product telescopes:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]
Since \( 64 = 4^3 \), we have \( \ln 64 = 3 \ln 4 \), so \( \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3 \).

Now evaluate the first product:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]
Separate into two telescoping products:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}.
\]
The first product simplifies:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31.
\]
The second product simplifies:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}.
\]
Thus
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}.
\]

The original product is therefore
\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}.
\]

Since \( \gcd(93, 13) = 1 \), we have \( m = 93 \), \( n = 13 \), and
\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106.
\]

\boxed{106}

[2026-02-25 17:35:50] [DEBUG] user_content:
Question: The product $ \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})} = \frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} \cdot \frac{\log_6(5^{35})}{\log_7(5^{32})} \cdots \frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})} $ is equal to $ \frac{m}{n} $, where $ m $ and $ n $ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $ m + n $.

Here are some previous responses to the question with their critiques:

Previous Answer:
We are given a product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

It is written out explicitly as:

\[
\frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} \cdot \frac{\log_6(5^{35})}{\log_7(5^{32})} \cdots \frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})}
\]

We need to simplify this product and express it as a rational number m/n in lowest terms, then compute m+n.

Let's examine the general term for k from 4 to 63:

\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

Recall that \(\log_a(b^c) = c \log_a b\). Also note that \(\log_a b = \frac{1}{\log_b a}\). Alternatively, we can write logarithms with a common base. Let's use the change-of-base formula: \(\log_a b = \frac{\ln b}{\ln a}\).

So:

\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}.
\]

Similarly,

\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}.
\]

Therefore, the term becomes:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}}{(k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

So the product over k=4 to 63 is:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \left( \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right).
\]

Now, let's write this product separately:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product is a telescoping product in the logarithms:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]

So the product simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}.
\]

Now we need to evaluate \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). Note that \(\ln 64 = \ln (4^3) = 3 \ln 4\), so \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3\). So that part is just 3.

Thus the product is:

\[
3 \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}.
\]

Now we need to compute:

\[
P = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]

Write it out for a few terms to see if it telescopes.

Let's write P explicitly:

\[
P = \frac{(4-1)(4+1)}{(4-2)(4+2)} \cdot \frac{(5-1)(5+1)}{(5-2)(5+2)} \cdot \frac{(6-1)(6+1)}{(6-2)(6+2)} \cdots \frac{(63-1)(63+1)}{(63-2)(63+2)}.
\]

That is:

\[
P = \frac{3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 6} \cdot \frac{4 \cdot 6}{3 \cdot 7} \cdot \frac{5 \cdot 7}{4 \cdot 8} \cdot \frac{6 \cdot 8}{5 \cdot 9} \cdots \frac{62 \cdot 64}{61 \cdot 65}? 
\]

Wait careful: For k=4, we have (k-1)(k+1)/(k-2)(k+2) = 3*5/(2*6).
For k=5: 4*6/(3*7).
For k=6: 5*7/(4*8).
For k=7: 6*8/(5*9).
...
For k=63: (62)*(64)/(61)*(65)? Check: k=63: (63-1)=62, (63+1)=64, (63-2)=61, (63+2)=65. So yes, the last factor is (62*64)/(61*65).

So the product from k=4 to 63 is a telescoping product. Let's write it as:

Numerator factors: For each k, numerator contains (k-1) and (k+1).
Denominator factors: (k-2) and (k+2).

Now, as k runs from 4 to 63, (k-1) runs from 3 to 62. But note that (k-1) appears in numerator of the term for k, and also appears in denominator of the term for k+1? Actually, look at denominator: For a given k, denominator includes (k-2) and (k+2). So the cancellation pattern: 

Consider factor (k-1). It appears in numerator of term with index k. Does it appear anywhere in denominator? Possibly in denominator of term with index k+1? For term with index k+1, denominator includes ((k+1)-2) = (k-1). Yes! So (k-1) cancels between numerator of term k and denominator of term k+1, for k from 4 to 62. Similarly, factor (k+1) appears in numerator of term k, and might appear in denominator of term k-1? For term k-1, denominator includes ((k-1)+2) = (k+1). Yes! So (k+1) cancels between numerator of term k and denominator of term k-1, for k from 5 to 63.

Also, factors (k-2) and (k+2) appear in denominators, and likely have corresponding numerators from other terms.

Let's write the product in expanded form to see exactly which factors remain.

We have:

P = 
(3*5)/(2*6) * 
(4*6)/(3*7) * 
(5*7)/(4*8) * 
(6*8)/(5*9) *
... *
(61*63)/(60*64) *   (this is for k=62? Let's compute: for k=62: (62-1)(62+1)/(62-2)(62+2) = 61*63/60*64)
(62*64)/(61*65).   (this is for k=63)

So the product runs from k=4 to k=63. The pattern:

First term (k=4): 3*5 / (2*6)
Second (k=5): 4*6 / (3*7)
Third (k=6): 5*7 / (4*8)
Fourth (k=7): 6*8 / (5*9)
...
Second to last: For k=62: (61*63)/(60*64)
Last: For k=63: (62*64)/(61*65)

Now, multiply all numerators together and all denominators together.

Numerator overall product: 
3*5 * 4*6 * 5*7 * 6*8 * ... * 61*63 * 62*64.

We can group factors (k-1) and (k+1) separately. Actually, the numerator is product over k=4 to 63 of (k-1)(k+1) = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-1) * ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+1).

Similarly, denominator: product over k=4 to 63 of (k-2)(k+2) = ��_{k=4}^{63} (k-2) * ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+2).

Let's compute these products separately.

Let A = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-1). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k-1). That is exactly product from j=3 to 62 of j, where j = k-1. So A = 3 * 4 * 5 * ... * 62.

Let B = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+1). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k+1). That is product from j=5 to 64 of j, where j = k+1. So B = 5 * 6 * 7 * ... * 64.

So numerator = A * B = (3*4*5*...*62) * (5*6*...*64).

Denominator: C = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k-2). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k-2) = product from j=2 to 61 of j (since j = k-2). So C = 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * 61.

D = ∏_{k=4}^{63} (k+2). This is product from k=4 to 63 of (k+2) = product from j=6 to 65 of j (since j = k+2). So D = 6 * 7 * ... * 65.

So denominator = C * D = (2*3*4*...*61) * (6*7*...*65).

Then P = (A*B)/(C*D). We can cancel common factors.

Notice that A = 3*4*5*...*62. C = 2*3*4*...*61. So A/C = (3*4*...*62)/(2*3*...*61) = 62/2 = 31. Actually careful: 
A = 3*4*5*...*62.
C = 2*3*4*...*61.
So A/C = (3*4*...*62)/(2*3*...*61) = (62)/(2) = 31. Because all factors from 3 to 61 cancel, leaving 62/2 = 31.

Now B = 5*6*...*64.
D = 6*7*...*65.
So B/D = (5*6*...*64)/(6*7*...*65) = 5/65 = 1/13. Because all factors from 6 to 64 cancel, leaving 5/65 = 1/13.

Thus P = (A/C)*(B/D) = 31 * (1/13) = 31/13.

Wait, check: B = 5*6*...*64, D = 6*7*...*65. So indeed B/D = 5/65 = 1/13. Yes.

Thus the product P = 31/13.

Then the original product is 3 * P = 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

Now we need to check if 93/13 is in lowest terms. 93 = 3 * 31, 13 is prime, so gcd(93,13)=1. So m=93, n=13. Then m+n = 93+13 = 106.

But wait: Did we correctly compute the telescoping? Alternatively, we can notice the telescoping pattern directly:

Write P as:

P = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{k+1}{k+2}.

But careful: That factorization is not exactly two separate products because they share the index k. Actually we can separate:

P = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} \right).

Now, the first product: \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2}. Write terms: For k=4: 3/2; k=5: 4/3; k=6: 5/4; ...; k=63: 62/61. So product telescopes to (62/2) = 31.

The second product: \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = For k=4: 5/6; k=5: 6/7; ...; k=63: 64/65. So product telescopes to (5/65) = 1/13. Indeed, product = (5/6)*(6/7)*...*(64/65) = 5/65 = 1/13.

So P = 31 * (1/13) = 31/13. Same.

Thus the original product is 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

So m=93, n=13, m+n=106.

But is that the final answer? Let's double-check the problem statement: The product is given as equal to \(\frac{m}{n}\), relatively prime positive integers. We got 93/13. But maybe we made a mistake in the logarithm simplification? Let's re-check the first step.

Original term: \(\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}\). We rewrote as \(\frac{(k^2-1) \log_k 5}{(k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5}\). Then we used \(\log_k 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}\), \(\log_{k+1} 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}\). So indeed the \(\ln 5\) cancels, giving \(\frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}\). That seems correct.

Then product over k gives \(\prod \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}\). The second product telescopes from k=4 to 63: \(\frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). And \(\ln 64 = \ln(2^6) = 6 \ln 2\), \(\ln 4 = \ln(2^2) = 2 \ln 2\), so ratio = 3. Correct.

Now compute \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). That is indeed \(\frac{(4^2-1)(5^2-1)\cdots(63^2-1)}{(4^2-4)(5^2-4)\cdots(63^2-4)}\). We factored as difference of squares: \(k^2-1=(k-1)(k+1)\), \(k^2-4=(k-2)(k+2)\). So product becomes \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}\). And we telescoped it correctly. So answer seems to be 93/13, m+n=106.

But let's verify with a small example: If the product were from k=4 to, say, 5, then we would have:

\(\frac{\log_4(5^{15})}{\log_5(5^{12})} \cdot \frac{\log_5(5^{24})}{\log_6(5^{21})} = \frac{15 \log_4 5}{12 \log_5 5} \cdot \frac{24 \log_5 5}{21 \log_6 5} = \frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{24}{21} \cdot \frac{\log_4 5}{\log_6 5}\). And using change of base, \(\frac{\log_4 5}{\log_6 5} = \frac{\ln 5 / \ln 4}{\ln 5 / \ln 6} = \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). So product = \(\frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{24}{21} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). That equals \(\frac{15 \cdot 24}{12 \cdot 21} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4} = \frac{360}{252} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4} = \frac{10}{7} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 4}\). According to our formula, it should be \(3 \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{5} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). Compute that: For k=4: (16-1)/(16-4)=15/12=5/4, for k=5: (25-1)/(25-4)=24/21=8/7. So product of those two: (5/4)*(8/7)=40/28=10/7. Then times 3 gives 30/7. But we computed the product as (10/7)*(ln6/ln4). That is not equal to 30/7 unless ln6/ln4 = 3, which is false because ln6/ln4 ≈ 1.292. So there's a discrepancy. Wait, careful: In our derivation, we had the product equal to 3 times the product of the rational factors. But for the small case from k=4 to 5, the product should be:

According to our derived formula: The product from k=4 to N is: \(\frac{\ln(N+1)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{N} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). For N=5, ln(N+1)=ln6, so it's (ln6/ln4) * (15/12 * 24/21) = (ln6/ln4)*(10/7). That is not 3 * (10/7) because ln6/ln4 is not 3. In the full problem from k=4 to 63, we got ln64/ln4 = ln(4^3)/ln4 = 3. So indeed the factor becomes 3 only because 64 = 4^3. In the small case with N=5, ln6/ln4 is not an integer power. So our formula was: Product = \(\frac{\ln(64)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\) specifically because the upper limit is 63, so the last term in the logarithm product gives ln64. In general, the product from k=4 to N gives \(\frac{\ln(N+1)}{\ln 4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{N} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\). So we are correct for N=63, because ln64/ln4 = 3. So our answer should be correct.

Thus the product is 3 * (31/13) = 93/13.

But wait: Let's check the product explicitly written in the problem: It starts with k=4 and ends with k=63. The last fraction is \(\frac{\log_{63}(5^{3968})}{\log_{64}(5^{3965})}\). For k=63, we have \(k^2-1 = 3969-1=3968\), and \(k^2-4=3969-4=3965\). So indeed k runs 4 to 63. And then the logarithm part telescopes to \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). But is it exactly \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\)? Let's check: The product of the logarithm ratios from k=4 to 63: \(\frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}\). So yes.

Now, note that \(\ln 64 / \ln 4 = \log_4 64 = \log_4 (4^3) = 3\). So that's fine.

So answer is 93/13, m+n=106.

But let's also compute the product \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4}\) carefully by telescoping the separate fractions as we did, but maybe there is another way: Write it as \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)/(k-2)}{(k+2)/(k+1)}\). Actually, \(\frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)} = \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \frac{k+1}{k+2}\). So product = (\(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2}\)) (\(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}\)) = (62/2) * (5/65) = 31 * 1/13 = 31/13. Yes.

So final product = 3 * 31/13 = 93/13.

Thus m=93, n=13, m+n=106.

We should check if the problem expects m+n, and whether the product is indeed m/n in lowest terms. 93/13 is already in lowest terms (13 is prime, 93 not divisible by 13). So answer is 106.

But wait: Could there be any simplification we missed? Possibly the logarithms could be simplified using base 5? Alternatively, we could compute directly using change-of-base to base 5.

Let’s try an alternative approach: Use base 5 logarithms.

We have: \(\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = \frac{k^2-1}{\log_5 k}\). Because \(\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = \frac{k^2-1}{\log_5 k}\).

Similarly, \(\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = \frac{k^2-4}{\log_5 (k+1)}\).

So the term becomes: \(\frac{(k^2-1)/\log_5 k}{(k^2-4)/\log_5 (k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\log_5 (k+1)}{\log_5 k}\).

Then the product over k becomes: \(\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_5 (k+1)}{\log_5 k} = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \right) \cdot \frac{\log_5 64}{\log_5 4}\).

And \(\frac{\log_5 64}{\log_5 4} = \log_4 64 = 3\). So same.

Thus consistent.

Therefore, the answer is 106.

I will answer: 106.

But let's write a complete explanation.

</think>
We simplify the product step by step.

The general term for \( k = 4, 5, \dots, 63 \) is
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}.
\]
Using the power rule and change-of-base formula,
\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k},
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \frac{\ln 5}{\ln(k+1)}.
\]
Thus the term becomes
\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \ln 5 / \ln k}{(k^2-4) \ln 5 / \ln(k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The product over \( k = 4 \) to \( 63 \) factors as
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product telescopes:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]
Since \( 64 = 4^3 \), we have \( \ln 64 = 3 \ln 4 \), so \( \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3 \).

Now evaluate the first product:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]
Separate into two telescoping products:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}.
\]
The first product simplifies:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31.
\]
The second product simplifies:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}.
\]
Thus
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}.
\]

The original product is therefore
\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}.
\]

Since \( \gcd(93, 13) = 1 \), we have \( m = 93 \), \( n = 13 \), and
\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106.
\]

\boxed{106}

I need to answer the question again, but ensure I follow the step-by-step reasoning clearly and avoid any potential misinterpretations. The previous answer was correct, but I should present it in a structured manner.

The product is given as:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

We need to express it as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) in lowest terms, then find \(m+n\).

Let me simplify step by step.

**Step 1: Simplify each term**

For a given \(k\):

\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5
\]

So the term becomes:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \log_k 5}{(k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5}
\]

**Step 2: Use change of base to express in terms of natural logs (or any common base)**

\[
\log_k 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}, \quad \log_{k+1} 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}}{(k^2-4) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}
\]

**Step 3: Write the product from \(k=4\) to \(63\)**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \left( \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right) = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right)
\]

**Step 4: Telescope the logarithm product**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}
\]

Since \(64 = 4^3\), \(\ln 64 = 3 \ln 4\), so:

\[
\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3
\]

**Step 5: Simplify the product of the rational parts**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}
\]

We can separate this into two products:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}
\]

Now telescope each:

- For the first product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31
\]

- For the second product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}
\]

Thus:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}
\]

**Step 6: Combine the results**

The original product is:

\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}
\]

**Step 7: Check if \(\frac{93}{13}\) is in lowest terms**

\(93 = 3 \times 31\), and \(13\) is prime, so \(\gcd(93, 13) = 1\). Thus \(m = 93\), \(n = 13\), and:

\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106
\]

I'll present the answer as \(\boxed{106}\).

</think>

We simplify the product step by step.

For each \(k\) from \(4\) to \(63\), the general term is
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}.
\]
Using the power rule for logarithms and the change-of-base formula,
\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1)\log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k},
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4)\log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln(k+1)}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})} = \frac{(k^2-1) \ln 5 / \ln k}{(k^2-4) \ln 5 / \ln(k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The product over \(k=4\) to \(63\) factors as
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product telescopes:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]
Since \(64 = 4^3\), \(\ln 64 = 3 \ln 4\), so \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3\).

Now evaluate the first product:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]
Separate into two telescoping products:
\[
\left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} \right).
\]
Compute each:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31,
\]
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}.
\]

The original product is therefore
\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}.
\]

Since \(\gcd(93,13) = 1\), we have \(m = 93\) and \(n = 13\), so
\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106.
\]

\[
\boxed{106}

[2026-02-25 17:36:32] [DEBUG] 生成的完整答案:
I need to answer the question again, but ensure I follow the step-by-step reasoning clearly and avoid any potential misinterpretations. The previous answer was correct, but I should present it in a structured manner.

The product is given as:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}
\]

We need to express it as a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) in lowest terms, then find \(m+n\).

Let me simplify step by step.

**Step 1: Simplify each term**

For a given \(k\):

\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1) \log_k 5
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5
\]

So the term becomes:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \log_k 5}{(k^2-4) \log_{k+1} 5}
\]

**Step 2: Use change of base to express in terms of natural logs (or any common base)**

\[
\log_k 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}, \quad \log_{k+1} 5 = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{(k^2-1) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k}}{(k^2-4) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln (k+1)}} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k}
\]

**Step 3: Write the product from \(k=4\) to \(63\)**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \left( \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right) = \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} \right)
\]

**Step 4: Telescope the logarithm product**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln (k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}
\]

Since \(64 = 4^3\), \(\ln 64 = 3 \ln 4\), so:

\[
\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3
\]

**Step 5: Simplify the product of the rational parts**

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}
\]

We can separate this into two products:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2}
\]

Now telescope each:

- For the first product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31
\]

- For the second product:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}
\]

Thus:

\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}
\]

**Step 6: Combine the results**

The original product is:

\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}
\]

**Step 7: Check if \(\frac{93}{13}\) is in lowest terms**

\(93 = 3 \times 31\), and \(13\) is prime, so \(\gcd(93, 13) = 1\). Thus \(m = 93\), \(n = 13\), and:

\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106
\]

I'll present the answer as \(\boxed{106}\).

</think>

We simplify the product step by step.

For each \(k\) from \(4\) to \(63\), the general term is
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})}.
\]
Using the power rule for logarithms and the change-of-base formula,
\[
\log_k(5^{k^2-1}) = (k^2-1)\log_k 5 = (k^2-1) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln k},
\]
\[
\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4}) = (k^2-4)\log_{k+1} 5 = (k^2-4) \cdot \frac{\ln 5}{\ln(k+1)}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{\log_k(5^{k^2-1})}{\log_{k+1}(5^{k^2-4})} = \frac{(k^2-1) \ln 5 / \ln k}{(k^2-4) \ln 5 / \ln(k+1)} = \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The product over \(k=4\) to \(63\) factors as
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} \cdot \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k}.
\]

The second product telescopes:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{\ln(k+1)}{\ln k} = \frac{\ln 5}{\ln 4} \cdot \frac{\ln 6}{\ln 5} \cdot \frac{\ln 7}{\ln 6} \cdots \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 63} = \frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4}.
\]
Since \(64 = 4^3\), \(\ln 64 = 3 \ln 4\), so \(\frac{\ln 64}{\ln 4} = 3\).

Now evaluate the first product:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{(k-1)(k+1)}{(k-2)(k+2)}.
\]
Separate into two telescoping products:
\[
\left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} \right) \cdot \left( \prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} \right).
\]
Compute each:
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k-1}{k-2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdots \frac{62}{61} = \frac{62}{2} = 31,
\]
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k+1}{k+2} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdots \frac{64}{65} = \frac{5}{65} = \frac{1}{13}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\prod_{k=4}^{63} \frac{k^2-1}{k^2-4} = 31 \cdot \frac{1}{13} = \frac{31}{13}.
\]

The original product is therefore
\[
3 \cdot \frac{31}{13} = \frac{93}{13}.
\]

Since \(\gcd(93,13) = 1\), we have \(m = 93\) and \(n = 13\), so
\[
m + n = 93 + 13 = 106.
\]

\[
\boxed{106}

The provided answer is thorough and accurate. Each step is logically justified: the logarithm terms are simplified using power and change-of-base rules, the product is separated into telescoping components, and each telescoping product is correctly evaluated. The final fraction \(\frac{93}{13}\) is in lowest terms, and the sum \(m+n=106\) is correctly computed. The reasoning is clear, complete, and free of errors or omissions. No issues requiring deduction are identified.
